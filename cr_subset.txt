speaker yield myself such time may consume
speaker begin thanking good friend from rochester the distinguished chair the committee rules slaughter for yielding the customary minutes and congratulate her and all our colleagues their membership the congress have heard from the speeches delivered the speaker and the republican leader today marks the start the congress new beginning for the first branch and for the peoples house was stated weeks from today are going making history with the inauguration barack obama presidentelect obama has already reached out congressional republicans expressing his desire work with this new congress all know very well what honorable campaign obama ran while didnt support his candidacy like many colleagues and fellow americans was inspired his message hope unity and change for the future laid out vision that replaces bitterness with bipartisanship cynicism with sincere commitment brighter future course there great divergence opinion the details exactly how reach that brighter future congressional republicans have our agenda feel very strongly about are committed more than ever the principles for which stand but wholeheartedly agree with obama that the way forward through open inclusive debate strong spirit bipartisanship and the sincere pursuit common ground unfortunately the highminded rhetoric the presidential campaign only highlights the pure cynicism this rules package that are considering today the democratic leadership this house poised consider its very first legislative act this congress rules package that literally shreds the obama vision going repeat that speaker the package that are going voting today literally shreds the obama vision fourteen days before even inaugurated into office the presidentelects plan for unity and bipartisanship being obstructed his own party this rules package takes the abysmal record the last congress and actually makes more restrictive you will hear lot today about arcane procedural tactics and wonder how has any relevance the problems that face nation but these changes speaker have enormous consequences for the conduct and outcome our policy debates speaker process substance tackle enormously important issues like everyone has said getting our economy back track cannot achieve good outcome without good process are very attuned the concept history being made right now and weeks from today perhaps should look history the motion recommit know today was granted the minority years ago following rebellion against the most dictatorial speaker the last century joseph gurney uncle joe cannon this motion ensures that the minority gets least one opportunity one opportunity offer amendment alternative during the democrats year reign they routinely denied republicans often dozens times congress the single bite the apple one opportunity offer alternative speaker when took the majority guaranteed the right the motion recommit and never never denied this body has always been governed majority rule the majority has number tools its disposal not least which the rules committee itself which privileged serve thats how they advance their agenda effective majority can abide the rules and traditions the house and still succeed legislatively contrast the congress the democratic leadership chose instead resort procedural gimmickry advance their agenda they had every legislative advantage the majority party and yet they felt compelled trample the traditions the house rather than build consensus engage actual deliberation they went far shut down the appropriations process avoid open debate speaker for the motion recommit that one single opportunity that one single opportunity for minority input the democratic leadership frequently resorted legislative tricks deny now the democratic leadeiship longer content shut down debate hoc basis they are making official with this rules package the underlying resolution contains host new procedural gimmicks stifle debate and perpetuate partisanship this resolution changes the rules the house formally limit formally limit the motion recommit this limitation prevents any bill from being returned committee for further deliberation restricts members ability strip out tax increases apparently the democratic majority believes tax increases are sacred but open debate not sacred this rules package also manipulates our budget rules once again protect tax increases well protect spending increases you see speaker the democratic leadership not only spent the last congress shutting out republicans they also had find clever ways shut out fiscally conservative democrats trying build consensus within their own party was very time consuming they learned their lesson though this rules package guts the budget rules that many democrats hold dear the laundry list rules changes goes they cut term limits for committee chairmen they scrap medicare costcontainment measures and all this werent enough they include completely closed rules completely closed rules for the two bills that will considered later this week without ever having the rules committee meet apparently the democratic leadership scoured the house rules for accountability and transparency measures and systematically dismantled what they found much speaker for the obama vision while calling for the most transparent administration our nations history his congressional democrats are launching the most closed congress history but believe that presidentelect obama sincere since the day was elected has been reaching out republicans has called many individually express sincere desire move beyond the divisiveness politics and work together can only imagine the chagrin his own party their attempt undermine his best efforts todays rules package huge step backward sets the stage for even more closed bitter rancorous debate the next major item the agenda more than trillion stimulus package republican leader john boehner has laid out several modest but critically important requests for open process there should public hearings the text should available online for full week prior vote there should specialinterest earmarks these are commonsense guidelines that are widely supported the american people they understand that our response the economic crisis too important allow slapped together secret behind closed doors and rammed through the house both democrats and republicans have number good ideas that should considered and debated today will pursuing economic recovery package that focuses progrowth policies introducing trio bills aimed growing our economy simplifying and reducing the tax burden individuals and job creators jumpstarting our housing market and reviving the auto industry hope can move forward these kinds policies but neither nor colleagues ask prejudge the outcome those debates simply ask that that debate take place majority leader hoyer agrees and said interview that had this past sunday can only hope able convince the speaker keep the process open and transparent her leaderships first legislative act this congress any indication wont fruitful endeavor speaker todays new beginning nothing more than new low for the democratic majority their cynicism and manipulation all the more dismal against the backdrop presidentelect obamas vision for hope unity and change for the better the democratic majoritys actions today not represent change that fulfills hope this change that denies hope speaker urge colleagues oppose this rules package reserve the balance time

yield back the balance time
speaker let just say that the spirit the debate here refusal yield indicative exactly what this rules package consists with that speaker would like yield minutes our very good friend from springfield missouri
speaker thank the gentleman for yielding speaker think are here today the minority side perhaps victims our own success the last congress clearly were able use this the only tool that often had available and used with great success used with great success that didnt destroy the legislative process fact many days the legislative process had already been destroyed there was committee markup there was hearing often the bills came from somewhere the leaders office the speakers office didnt know where they came from because didnt see them until the day they were headed the floor the day before they were headed the floor werent given amendments werent given substitutes but were given years ago these tools the motions recommit the majority would probably argue that somehow this makes the process unworkable but there are number examples the last congress where the process was very workable the public housing management act that was brought the floor february sires mrs bachmann offered motion recommit block the federal government from restricting possession otherwise legal firearms for these residents when she offered the motion the bill was pulled the committee then met the motion would have required them added that provision the bill and brought back the floor few days later the americorps bill authorize and expand americorps was considered march kuhl made motion recommit that was prompt nature prohibit sex offenders and murderers from receiving these grants the bill was pulled six days later the same bill was brought including kuhls language the idea that this ruins the process the idea that bill that you have never seen before the day coming the floor the day before coming the floor dont need have tools bring new ideas the floor just wrong urge that this rules package defeated
speaker delighted yield minutes the gentleman from massachusetts the chair the financial services committee
the former minority whip has just proved the opposite his case the one instance that refers where bill came out the committee which chair were prepared accept that amendment the floor was offered promptly asked could done often did forthwith and could have been adopted the floor that case wasnt days took several weeks because cannot drop everything and get bill now understand that when bill sent back committee all the rules apply and the way nothing stops you from making this revolving door speaker people can keep doing this the motion recommit members have said the other side they want able offer alternative nothing this proposal any way diminishes their ability offer alternative they are fully able offer alternative amendment what they will losing here legislative ponzi scheme which you pretend something you are not here the way works the minority wants under any bill offer motion recommit the rule will now read this passes they can offer motion recommit with germane amendment that binding and adopted the bill amended the spot but they often dont want that often their amendments are really disguises for opposition the bill general they take amendment that would pass virtually unanimously because popular and say should done way that sends the bill back committee rather than amend the bill lets very clear their ability offer motion that amendment the bill way diminished this way changed exactly the same what they lose the ability take something that would pass overwhelmingly they would allow serious vote and use way get bill sent back committee for purposes delay now the gentleman right doesnt always work sometimes the bill survives sometimes doesnt there often traffic jam the floor there are also cases where timeliness important where the administration may about something want stop them from doing and want able move reasonably quickly will say this with regard where said bills came from nowhere the bills where this tactic this ponzi scheme has been used bills that have come out the financial services committee were not those bills they were bills where there had been open amendment processes where have often gone the rules committee and asked for amendments order fact experience the committee jurisdiction leadership has input into these motions have asked there are amendments offered the floor that were never offered committee when they had chance offered and will guarantee you that fact because the purpose not amend the bill youwere trying amend the bill you offer the motion recommit way that amends the floor that not good enough for them because they are not interested substance they are interested this game playing and this charade well not charade because that talking they are interested this pretense whereby you try slow bill down because you arent willing vote against this rules package passes there will two options for the minority they can move send the bill back committee that can still done the motion send back committee will still there they can move amend the floor their ability offer alternative ways changed what they cant pretend amending the bill putting forward very popular language that would pass overwhelmingly but doing way that effect sends the bill back committee which doesnt allow the house adopt that amendment and then they want able say members werent favor this noncontroversial piece legislative ponzi scheme pretense something that ought abolished does not add all the legitimacy debate lets adopt this rules change the minority will have the two options and that all that democracy requires
speaker this time happy yield minutes good friend from richmond virginia the distinguished republican whip
speaker thank the gentleman speaker you dont have look far see that families across this country are gripped with tremendous amount fear and uncertainty they fear for their jobs they have one they fear for their future they see their their college savings accounts collapse they fear that their elected leaders dont get they fear that this congress may very well incapable change incapable producing the kind results that they want and get right under existing house rules when bill brought the floor that includes tax increase the minority has right offer motion strike that increase and the republican minority had done that nearly half zen occasions over the past years with this rule change now though house democrats are trying push through whpt republicans will longer have the ability say higher taxes will not able simply strike tax increase and demand down vote fact the only option will have would replace one tax increasewith another there will ability for cut texes lighten the burden the middleclass families that are hurting right now one can see that this rule change makes lot easier for the democrat majority fact hide tax increases inside other larger bills fact that why all are sitting here scratching our heads the house democrats feel tax increase necessary then why wouldnt they allow for full and open debate why not let the american people have say why not let the hardworking people this country hear why washington once again looking take more their hard earned money either way what clear this type partisan rules change flies the face new era openness and transparency that presidentelect obama has promised take the presidentelect his word believe wants transparency openness and debate believe wants washington begin business differently believe serious wanting congress work together for the good all our constituents but apparently that word hasnt made its way down the leadership the house

speaker this time happy yield minutes our very good friend from menomonee falls wisconsin
thank the gentleman very much speaker beginning year here and one the things that have learned both being the majority and being the minority that procedural fairness the antithesis partisanship want repeat that procedural fairness the antithesis partisanship this rules package and particularly the changes the motion recommit will bring about more partisanship and would ask friends the majority side reconsider what they are proposing here the previous speakers the republican side have stated instances the last years where has resulted excessive partisanship because changes that have been made the motions recommit hoc basis allowing the majority pull the bill their choice not ours because they set the schedule not having motions recommit certain bills and not allowing strike proposed tax increases what wrong with debating these issues and what wrong the majority this house representatives which seats more democratic than the one that just expired agrees with the republican minority every once awhile what are you afraid are you afraid losing few more motions recommit that the motivation behind this shame you because you are shutting down the process and you are going result more partisanship not less you are going result having the country even more divided not less and that goes exactly against what our new president has been trying with practically everything said since won the election months ago
speaker pleased yield minutes the gentleman from massachusetts
the gentleman from wisconsin said why will the majority not some instances agree with the minority thats the problem are talking about cases where the majority have tried agree with the minority and they would not agreed with they would not take yes for answer this the issue they offer motion recommit and says forthwith and they win the vote the bill amended they offer amendment bill not having offered committee not having gone the rules committee ask the floor they take noncontroversial popular issue and offer the motion recommit but say should sent the committee and reported back promptly have tried agree with them and they have refused this literally way not take yes for answer its way take something which the majority would like agree have been here when and when the majority leader has said such situation could get unanimous consent simply agree that now and the minority has said well people have right not agreed with people have right not agreeable some indulge that right more than others but you dont have right refuse agreed with and then complain that you werent agreed with and thats all thats stake here yes there are times when the majority should say yes the minority and that should determined the floor what were saying the minority should not manufacture situation which there way say yes them because their goal patently not amend that particular bill because was they would accept the request that that amendment accepted instead put bill back committee because theyre afraid vote against thats the issue this used way send bills back committee avoid votes and this leaves triis package the minority fully able offer any motion recommit send back committee just says they cant play games

speaker this time like yield minute the gentleman from roanoke virginia
speaker was here when the republicans gained the majority the congress for the first time years and remember the reforms that put into place term limits comiittee chairmen where before chairmen who could barely walk into this chamber were serving chairs committees simply because seniority well weve thrown that out today guess thats change but its really change back was here january when changed the rules motions recommit make easier for the minority offer motions recommit well guess weve changed that because now youve made more difficult offer real improvements legislation rolling back the motion recommit yes have change the air but that change simply going back this not progress for this congress and very much regret that the democratic leadership has chosen curtail the rights the minority and not bring forward the kind progress that comes from having term limits committee chairmen the new criteria for determining emergency situations that allow them waive their own paygo rules are laughable the rule appears that spending can designated emergency spending necessary unforeseen temporary nature would suspect that the majority believes that all their spending priorities are necessary these rule changes are abomination and every taxpayer should arms over these changes and the attitudes they represent common sense american families that they cannot spend more than they have and unfortunate that common sense seems elude congress clear that congress must forced address its spending addiction the way accomplish this through amendment the constitution require balanced budget which just introduced few minutes ago here today with more than bipartisan cosponsors these rules are not reforms

this time happy yield minute our great relatively new member from new orleans
speaker the first vote this new congress gives preview what the leadership planning repeal reforms that make government more transparent over years the house established rules that open the legislative process make congress more accountable the rules package see today undermines the accountability have put place and encourages the old way doing business with backroom deals and dictatorlike authority ending term limits for committee chairs the democratic majority severely restricting opportunities for all members and encouraging dictatoriallike authority sixyear term limits for committee chairs prevents dictatorial concentration power since congress has seen some the lowest approval ratings history giving only few members the house positions permanent power are only going perpetuate that lack trust speaker the american people deserve better from the first day this new congress rise opposition these rules changes that roll back the clock important reforms

united states america stands firm believe that have just few other brief remarks colleagues are aware two democratic senate seatsone from illinois and the other from minnesotaare currently vacant will briefly address these two unusual circumstances because the inquiries have all had first the illinois seat left vacant presidentelect barack obama although not know burris personallyi hope meet him the next few dayshe has served the state illinois elective office over many years burris and his advisers were welcomed the capitol this morning sergeant arms terry gainer who was chief police chicago they have known each other for long time they then had gracious meeting with the secretary the senate nancy erickson and senate parliamentarian alan frumin who informed them that burris not possession the necessary credentials from the state illinois court case illinois pending determine whether secretary state jesse white obligated sign this certification are awaiting that court decision burris takes possession valid credentials the senate will proceed manner that respectful burris while ensuring there cloud doubt over the appointment fill this seat also understand that burris will likely give testimony the illinois state assembly impeachment proceedings the next few days these proceedings pending against governor blagojevich await that proceeding senators well minnesota know little bit about close elections only going talk about two them because have had number them lost one votes was statewide election for the senate that was trauniatic lose that race paul laxalt one the historic senators from nevadabut course for this country because his very close personal relationship with president reagan paul laxalt and are close personal friends but lost that vote went through recount didnt file any lawsuits there were challenges hard wasand was hard because that really the first thing had ever losti lost the race all over the country democrats were winning these senate seats and lost nevada but had give because hid chance winning won the second votes one reason john ensign and are soulmates because our politics are different but our friendship good gets that was tough election bitter election that john ensign and went through had recount nevada that was ongoing john ensign made decision that was waste time cant win the election before the recount was completed john ensign called mei was having dinner with wifeand said you are going the next senator thought when made that phone call gee this some kind good guy didnt handle loss nearly well did remember that anyway john ensign filed challenges didnt complete the recount there were lawsuits and john ensign now member the senate fortunate have number good friends but boy friend and think you ask him would say the same say friend norm coleman watch what have said and watch what has taken place the past the senate race minnesota was very close was very very closeone the closest history the bipartisan state canvassing board and minnesotas election officials have done exemplary job handling the recount there were allegations partisanship unfairness from either side that aware and followed every day for weeks even close elections though have winners can testify that after all votes have been fairly counted franken certified the winner the state canvassing board and the senatorelect from minnesota democrats will not seek seat senatorelect franken today understand the sensitivity both sides election this close this difficult time for former senator coleman and his family acknowledge

president suggest the absence quorum
president ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call rescinded
president january claiborne pell died claiborne pell was senator from rhode island the longest serving senator from that state senator whose name known most college students and most people who care about education america because was largely responsible for helping create what now call the pell grant federal scholarship that follows students the college their choice was originally called the basic educational opportunity grant but fell grant lot easier say remarkable success our country deserves remembered for that success knew him staff member when came here with senator howard baker who was here just few hours ago were sworn that was years ago knew him education secretary and the american higher education system time when worry about some our institutions one our great secret weapons america one our great strengths one reason for that because federal grants and loans all started not with the pell grant but just the end world war with the bill for veterans was college scholarship actually was educational scholarship the veterans could spend wherever they wished and the wherdver they wished point the important point because many those men and some women who came back from world war used their bill money high school some used college other countries the world one said you cant the university delaware you must notre dame you cant brown university you cant historically black college the bill for veterans followed the student the college that students choice was not universally popular the president the university chicago hutchins said the time that would create campus full hobos because college that time was for very limited number americans the end world war only percent americans and older had completed least years college but today according the most recent figures that figure six times that nearly percent americans have completed years college first the bill after world war then the pell grant then the various loans the federal government allows for students today percent the men and women who american colleges and universities have federal grant federal loan help them pay for college never easy afford college the average tuition year private school about today and you add that your living expenses important remember that average tuition year public university about and the average tuition and fees for community colleges senator fell his leadership and his work chairman the education subcommittee our health education and labor committee helped add the legacy the bill for veterans and helped make possible for many americans college wish conclude remarks and honor senator pell with thougpt about our future have always wondered why the pell grant was such good idea for colleges why dont try for kibdergarten through the grade seem overlook the fact that american students can choose their college and the money follows the student the college might nashville auto diesel college might harvard university but dont give the money the school give the student decide where that was happy accident that happened with the bill and was happy accident that happened remember saying one distinguished member this body you know the pell grant voucher this senator recoiled from that and said opposed vouchers said but you are not opposed the fell grant are you and she said well that different would argue that not different all what have done kindergarten grade give the money directly institutions and that sense create local educational monopolies and limit the amount competition choice can look our experience with higher education and see how generally considered far the best the world not only have the best colleges and universities the world have almost all them then look our system kindergarten through the grade the presiding officer has been governor his state worked hard charter schools have all tried many different ideas try improve kindergarten through grade but have never quite seemed able make effective our success with higher education that why suggested the senate floor that try the idea pell grant for kids ask unanimous consent have printed the record following remarks the remarks made the senate floor may about pell grants for kids
president summarize them they were simply this why not look the example our higher education system and try with kindergarten through the grade the fell grants for kids proposed was give every single child from middle lowincome family scholarship that would follow them the school other accredited academic program their choice these would new federal dollars district would see its share money from washington cut and would give less wealthy families many the same choices that families with money already have one example across our country see art and music lessons cut schools budgets get tight they are the first things that are cut the kids who the schools from the areas that have less money from property taxes and less money from sales taxes are not able have the art and music courses they had pell grant for kids they might take afterschool program for art afterschool program for music the parents might get together and the school the children attend and say look there are with these pell grants will all come here you hire art teacher part time music teacher part time would give parents some consumer power would give children opportunities and would give schools with less money more money this idea hope can seriously consider look ahead the future american public education should recognize that there are great many school districts with children who have less money and less tax base than others and that have had wonderful example with the bill for veterans and with fell grants colleges and universities why not try limited way see would help improve opportunity and education kindergarten through the grade has college main purpose today honor claiborne pell served years with distinction contributed greatly the opportunities education america did with dignity and did with intelligence respect him miss him and honor his legacy yield the floor exkmbrr half century after brown board education education equal terms still eludes too many africanamerican school children secretary education rod paige has called americas persistent racial achievement gap the civil rights issue our time the grade only one six black students and one five hispanic students are reading grade level math scores are equally disturbing only percent blacks and percent hispanics test proficient levels their senior year another standard about percent africanamerican children read below basic level the end the grade while percent white students read basic above the end the grade there still huge achievement gap among africanamerican children and white children the child left behind acts system standards and accountability creating foundation for closing the gap but funding disparities between rich and poortoo often minority children attend poorer schoolsschool districts remain stubborn contributor inequality between and poor students fell further behind their wealthier peers seven out nine key indicators including reading math and science these outcomes cry out for different model one that helps address funding and equality without raising property taxes that introduces entrepreneurship and choice into system monopolies and that offers school districts more federal dollars implement the requirements child left behind with fewer stringsin other words more federal dollars fewer federal strings and more parental say over how the federal dollars are spent does this sound too good true would suggest not look further than our nations bestintheworld higher educational system there find the pell grant program wilch has diversified and strengthened americas colleges and universities applying the principles autonomy and competition this year billion pell grants and work study and billion student loans will follow americas students the colleges their choice this sharp contrast the local monopolies have created kindergarten through the grade education where dollars flow directly schools with little say from parents that why proposing pell grants for kids annual scholarship that would follow every middle and lowincome child the school other accredited academic program his her parents choosing these are new federal dollars district would see cut its share washingtons billion annual appropriations for and increases funding for students with disabilities would contitlue armed with new purchasing power parents could directly support their schools priorities they could pay for tutoring for lessons and other services the private market parents affluent school districts this all the time pell grants for kids would give less wealthy families the same opportunitiesan example the holiday family nashville tennessee raymon holiday grader who recently won the american lung association tennessees clean air poster contest was there when won the speed bicycle you get for winning this poster competition met his father art major and his grandfather retired art teacher they told his greatgrandfather was musician you pan see where raymon holiday gqts his instincts his grandfather the retired art teacher lamented that art classes are usually the first when school budgets are cut with pell grants for kids typical middle school students raymon might one middle lowincome students who qualify receive pell grant his middle school would see increase funding raymon would assured art ldssons the pell grant model also encourages great american entrepreneurship enterprising principals like raymons principal might design programs attract parental investment advanced math classes writing workshops after school programs english lessonswhatever lacking due funding constraints surveys continue show that while americans are concerned with the state public education most support their own childs public school herman smith superintendent schools bryan texas would welcome the million that would accompany eligible bryan students percent his district bryan right next door college station home texas where according smith their budget cuts are larger than bryan dreams spending for new programs and personnel property values there are double those bryan the perpupil expenditure not surprisingly bryans population almost half africanamerican latino while college station threequarters white with million american school children eligible for pell grants for kids fellow fiscal conservatives are probably raising eyebrow but please listen every year congress appropriates increases funding for kindergarten through the grade what offering here plan earmark most these new dollarsaside from increases spending for children with disabilitiesfor parents spend educational programs their choice otherwise will continue invest the same bureaucracies that have disappointed poor and minority families for too long pell grants for kids could implemented gradually starting with kindergarten and grade initial cost billion the program had been place during president bushs first two years office the extra billion spent educationagain not counting another billion for children with disabilitieswould have created scholarships for all nine million middle and lowincome students through the grade have had years deliver american education equal terms all students but baffling commitment the status quo has prevented from living browns noble legacy this anniversary presents the perfect opportunity inaugurate new era one that uses the strategy that helped create the best colleges help create the best schools let start with pell grants for kids and move from there with all deliberate speed would like make several additional remarks about pell grants for kids mentioned the idea pretty simple one significantly new federal dollars fewer federal strings and more say parents about how the money spent give you idea how much money that would have taken quick look home state tennessee tennessee has students kindergarten through the grade pell grants for kids would eligible all those students who are from families below the state median income the state median income for family four tennessee about for families who have income below each their children would have scholarship that would follow that child the school other approved academic program his her parents choice june hope introduce piece legislation hopefully with bipartisan group senators july sen gregg and have already discussed hearing which will have the health education labor and pensions committee and then perhaps next year the president the united states might want make this part his budget believe time this country recognize need give poor and middleincome parents more the same choices educational opportunities wealthier families have and that may able this without harming our public schools have had since world war scholarships that have followed students the educational institutions their choice and they have done nothing but help create opportunity and create the best system colleges and universities the world think ought use the same idea try create the best schools the world estimate about percent all tennessee students would eligible for pell grant some the rural counties where there are great many poor children might percent the students other places such davidson county maryville and oak ridgeit might smaller percentage but all all there should about students tennessee who would eligible this would bring additional million tennessee for education and parents would have say over how that money spent often when this issue comes and talk about spending more federal dollars for local schools the senators side the aisle get little hot under the collar not want spend any more federal money for local schools the other hand when say lets give the parents more say how the money spent the collars geta little hot the other side the aisle because they are reluctant give parents more choice this conflict principles the principle equal opportunitygiving parents more choices but there another valid principle the other side called pluribus unum have public schools common schools teach our common culture and not want harm them proper debate this body saylets ask questions are giving parents more say more choices will that harm our common schools and there proper way ask this senate can wisely spend that much more money this quite bit more money fully funded pell grants for kids programs would cost billion new federal dollars year would add about the now spend each the children america today from the federal government only about percent the dollars spend children comes from the federal government would about percent increase federal funding for every middle lowincome child fully funded are proposing this over long period time basically add the new money that would appropriate every year for and give most that pell grants for kids this would create more equality funding for poor districts would especially help africanamerican and minority kids would provide extra dollars implement the standards child left behind and would introduce for the first time into our system the principle that has created the best colleges the worldthe idea letting money follow students the institution their choice over the next several weeks will discussingthis with individual senators have not prepared piece legislation yet because dont want stand and say here take leave lets say one team says choice and one team says money then are back where were looking for ways advance the debate dont believe are going spending much more money through the federal government the same way are doing today lot senators and one them not want spend more federal dollars through programs that have lots federal controls have seen the limit command and control from washington with child left behind that program will work but dont believe can expect give many more orders from washington make schools schenectady nashville and anniston alabama and sacramento better that has happen local communities the right strategy significantly new federal dollars with fewer federal strings and more parental say about how those dollars are spent this does not have republican versus democrat idea not the author this idea the bill for veterans was enacted since that time federal dollars have followed students the colleges their choice today percent americas college students have federal grant loan that follows them the college their choice when was president the university tennessee never occurred say the congress hope you not appropriate any money for children howard university notre dame brigham young vanderbilt morehouse the university alabama give people choices put another way neck the woods what told everyone where they had college what said sen sessions you have the university tennessee said young lamar alexander you have university alabama civil wars have been fought over such things that exactly what give people choice and have created the best colleges the world give them choices and have schools that wish were better the idea would try what worked for colleges here said was not the only one think this there was the bill for veteransthat was bipartisanafter world war maybe the best piece social legislation ever passed the history our country ted sizer perhaps the most renowned educator america today proposed poor childrens bill rights for every poor child any school his her choice lbj powerofthepeople liberal democratic idea the time president nixon proposed basically giving grants poor children choose among all schools the man who wrote that speech for president nixon was man named pat moynihan was senator and sen ribicoff two democrats introduced essentially exactly the idea proposing today fact sens ribicoff and moynihan proposed amending the federal pell grant act and simply applying elementary and secondary students that time when the pell grant was grader could get pell grant you were high school student and you were poor you could get pell grant senator moynihan said this body precisely the same reason ought apply elementary and secondary schoolingif that

president the opening new congress always important moment the life our nation every time gavel falls new legislative term are reminded the grandeur the document are sworn uphold are grateful the citizens our respective statesin case the people kentuckywho give the opportunity serve are thankful once again that the constitution has endured guarantee the freedom and the prosperity many for long the growth our nation over the years one the most remarkable feats man and was far from inevitable when congress first organized under the constitution the united states consisted states and million citizens today more people than that live kentucky alone yet despite bloody civil war the arrival millions immigrants economic collapse world wars social unrest and the longdelayed realization americas original promise equality for all have come together body and nation have not just endured these things have flourished and that well worth remembering and celebrating the congress convenes meet january america faces many serious challenges none more urgent than our troubled economy presidentelect obama was one those who recognized the gravity the current troubles early reassured many fielding solid team economic advisers agrees with republicans that should put more money the pockets middleclass american families cutting their taxes and has proposed working with republicans create jobs and encourage longterm economic stability with massive domestic spending bill the details which members congress and the american people are increasingly eager see after long and rough campaign season encouraging for many americans see that the two parties washington are broad agreement about something important their daily lives and republicans will work with presidentelect obama make sure that consider this legislation the taxpayer not taken for ride all agree the economy needs help are concerned and taxpayers are concerned but are going appropriate unprecedented amount money from the treasury for this spending bill absolutely essential that determine front whether the spending going wasteful wise specifically the american people should have least week and looks will have more than that see what this enormous spending plan includes president clinton proposed billion stimulus package his first year office congress back rejected for being too expensive now democrats congress are proposing stimulus that would cost taxpayers more than times what president clintons would have cost this potentially trillion bill would one the largest spending bills history would increase the deficit half trillion dollars overnight and deepen already enormous national debt before all agree the american people need see the details they need able see for themselves whether this money well spent lawmakers think then they need make convincing case the people who are paying for now years ago rejected similar stimulus the size the minnesota state budget should not rushed into voting for bill that any estimate will bigger than all state budgets combined especially when many the jobs promises will not even materialize for another year are serious about protecting the taxpayer these projects will awarded through fair and open process and allowed compete with other priorities the budget should encourage not discourage questions about this bill reckless rush meet arbitrary deadline should open new ideas aimed protecting the taxpayer here are three new ideas worth considering congressional democrats have talked about sending hundreds billions dollars the states loan those funds rather than give them away states will far less likely spend the money frivolously and the taxpayer would have greater assurance their money well spent idea congress has had nearly year review the fiscal spending requests these remaining bills now make billion omnibus appropriations bill this bill that meets the level spending proposed for the stimulus and bill that could pass congress inauguration day speed one the goals strikes that passing the omnibus achieves that goal idea middleclass tax relief one way get more money into peoples pockets quickly increase the size their paychecks immediately immediate percent cut taxes for nearly million americans would provide significant jolt the economy that all want these are ideas which both parties could agree each them designed protect and empower the taxpayer lets consider them but either way the american people should this spending plan because the potential for waste and abuse enormous now some looselipped local politicians have already described the grant free money from washington others openly hope use frivolous pet projects that sensible taxpayer would sign off they had choice the american people not want pickpocketed they not want taken advantage they want real return their investment and all should eager show that understand the difference presidentelect obama has said stimulus plan will have create jobs have immediate impact and lead the strengthening the longterm economy republicans agree and will help ensure just that insisting scrutiny and oversight the face pressure congressional democrats from interest groups and local politicians here issue which the republicans and democrats can work together for positive result for the american people hope that once achieve will have model build for the remainder the congress the opportunities for cooperation are numerous throughout his campaign presidentelect obama spoke about the importance strong national defense spoke the need reduce the national debt vowed through the budget line line cut wasteful programs pledged cut taxes virtually all americans and small business and promised put america the path energy independence within the next years these are all goals republicans support this moment nothing should stand the way our achieving them together have told the new president eager work with him have told him can expect cooperation the confirmation qualified nominees key cabinet posts the american people not have worry about power vacuum places such the pentagon the state department treasury homeland security have discussed with him something already knows but which worth repeating the first day the new congress when comes new presidents history offers clear path clear path success and clear path failure some new presidents have chosen work with the other party confront the big issues the day that neither party willing able tackle its own others have decided they would rather team with members their own party and focus narrow partisan issues that only appeal tiny sliver the populace but which lack the support the american mainstream view the choice this particular moment clear the new president pursues the former course our chances achieving positive for the american people will strong the parties will continue disagree this good for democracy but political conflict not end itself this moment have opportunity show the american people and know that the majority leader has mentioned that this year the opening congress coincides with two important anniversaries the first senator byrds anniversary this feat longevity has equal the history this body and this quite fitting for senator who has equal the history this body when robert carlyle byrd took the oath office january could not have known that would the longest serving senator history that would one day write this bodys definitive history but through the support his beloved erma his legendary devotion our constitution and his tireless will improve the lives the people his state the senior senator from west virginia has accomplished remarkable feat and today honor him for the other anniversary commemorate today doubt dear senator byrds heart because years ago this very month the senate moved from its old home down the hall where had the reenactment the swearing new senators todayits old home down the hall the room are now this transition meant far more its day than the mere packing books and rearranging desks because back then now every expansion the capitol has come with fresh realization the great adaptability the constitution and further proof its greatness according the congressional record the man who was selected speak the occasion the senates relocation was john breckenridge democrat and kentuckian who served vice president under president buchanan his remarks breckenridge offered eloquent lesson the history the senate and after paying appropriate tribute the heroes the revolution made intriguing suggestion the senators his day breckenridge suggested that the senators had even greater responsibility than the senators because put the population extent and the power our country surpass the dawning promise its origin this was true truer still americans have seen quite vividly over the past years and even over the past few months that the challenges which confront america and our response those challenges have powerful effect the wider world nat single member this body unaware the profound impact his her decisions and that why not single senator this body wishes anything but the best presidentelect obama despite party differences all feel certain institutional pride having one our own the white house and every american will feel special national pride when for the first time our nations history african american man raises his hand recite the oath office from the capitol steps the presidentelect has promised leadership that sees beyond the politics division but that responsibility does not rest with the president alone rests with all before inauguration day there the opening this congress this too great civic ritual and this too should renew our optimism about the future america and our optimism about achieving something important for the american people over these next years now our chance delivernot just word but deed this solemn charge for some might cut against the grain but are have future worthy our past charge that must kept yield the floor
president with the approaching hearings before the judiciary committee the nomination eric holder attorney general thought might useful frame some the issues and put them into perspective least perspective advance the hearings and advise holder some greater detail than our brief meeting when paid his courtesy call few weeks ago discuss some those issues would better position respond begin with the view that wish helpful presidentelect obama his dealings with the enormous problems which face our nation have come know presidentelect obama his capacity senator for the last years his office right down the hallway consider him friend and certainly are need action some the enormous problems our nation faces approach these problems the context our constitutional roles the constitution article gives certain powers the congress and article certain powers the executive branch the core our constitutional government checks and balances have that responsibility have oversight and give our candid judgments frequently more helpful say than say yes when deal with the position attorney general have role which significantly different from other cabinet officers for example cabinet officers carry out thepresidents policies wide variety issues and extent does the attorney general but the attorney general has significantly different role his responsibility the people and the rule law senator leahy and wrote extensively this subject published last october politico some attorneys general have been very compliant with the administration and have not fared very well historically attorney general harry daugherty was sullied the teapot dome scandal although ultimately cleared resigned amid allegations impropriety had the attorney general during the administration president roosevelt attorney general homer cummings who yielded the courtpacking plan certainly not the sort institutional integrity which would look for attorney general some attorneys general have been very diligent perhaps the best example attorney general elliot richardson who resigned rather than fire special prosecutor archibald cox during the administration president nixon and deputy attorney general bill ruckelshaus followed suit todays press there are reports about the distinguished career attorney general griffin bell who just died one the hallmarks attorney general bells career was his willingness say president carter who had appointed him president carter reported wanted dertain prosecution brought attorney general bell said that wasnt appropriate matter for criminal prosecution attorney general bell advised presidefit carter that the way would get that prosecution brought would appoint compliant attorney general that would resign before would undertake that prosecution have seen regrettably with the administration attorney general alberto gonzales yielding the executive will without upholding the rule law the hearings conducted the judiciary committee for which was ranking member over the termination attorneys the attitude attorney general gonzales habeas corpus testifying that there was positive grant habeas corpus the constitution notwithstanding the explicit clause which says habeas corpus may suspended only time rebellion invasion this very key and critical appointment the attorney general also has enormous responsibilities advising the president more generally the scope executive authority holder will doubtless questioned some length the issue the terrorist surveillance program warrantless wiretaps and the meaning the foreign intelligence surveillance act and where does congressional authority under article stop the flat prohibition against wiretaps without warrants contrasted with the executives power commander chief under article and what are the attorney general designates views attorneyclient privilege restrictions matter which initiated and which has seen further restrictions the thompson memorandum and subsequently last congress introduced legislation try deal with that there also the reporters privilege issue where the department justice has opposed the privilege for reporters where they have been held contempt new york times reporter was held jail for some days after the source the confidential disclosure had been addressed these are just few the issues which will looking the confirmation hearings attorney general holder with respect holder specifically has had outstanding academic and professional recordi acknowledged that early onprestigious college and school columbia judge the district columbia superior court involved department justice prosecution teams and later served deputy attorney general but aside from these qualifications holders resume there also the issue character sometimes more important for the attorney general have the stature and the courage say instead say yes there are three specific matters which will inquired into during the course holders confirmation hearing the first one involves highly publicized pardon the marc rich pardon holder testified was not intimately involved the rich pardon and assumed that regular procedures were being followed but when you take look some the details asto what was disclosed the hearing the house representatives and the hearing the senate judiciary committee which chaired months after the pardon holder met privately with richs attorney according holders own testimony tried facilitate meeting between the prosecutors the southern district new york and richs attorney richs attorney quinn testified that holder advised him straight the white house rather than through the pardon office which the regular procedure quinn produced email from himself colleague with the subject line eric which noted that says straight the also says timing good should get soon that not conclusive but these are matters inquired into the pardon attorney was opposed the pardon but never issued recommendation because didnt think the pardon was under serious consideration then the white house requested holders opinion and quoted saying that was neutral leaning towards favorable the pardon this case the record with the very close connections between rich and very sizable contributions the clinton library and very sizable contributions president clintons party these questions inevitably arise and have not been answered satisfactorily during the course the hearings both the house and the senate where chaired the full committee hearing the claim executive privilege was made face little different situation when are looking confirmation hearing for attorney general terms the legitimate scope senators inquiry which will pursued ought focused the fact that the charges against rich were very serious they involved tax evasion fraud trading with the enemy with iran should also emphasized that the attorney who prosecuted the case was opposed the pardon and fact refused meet with rich the second issue which requires hearing the issue character and the determination whether holder was yielding the president give him the vice president conclusion they wanted hear was the issue the appointment independent counsel the allegations that vice president gore engaged fundraising from the white house violation federal law holder his capacity deputy attorney general was advising attorney general reno attorney general reno came the conclusion that independent counsel ought not appointed the house representatives committee filed this report the failure the attorney general follow the law and appoint independent counsel for the entire campaign finance investigation has been the subject two sets committee hearings fbi director louis freeh and the attorney generals handpicked chief prosecutor charles labella wrote lengthy memos the attorney general advising her that she must appoint independent counsel under the mandatory section the independent counsel statute that mandatory section does not leave the discretion the attorney general but the attorney general declined appoint independent counsel hearings conducted before the senate judiciary subcommittee which chaired attorney general reno was questioned extensively the evidence which showed that hard money was being discussed the matter fundraising undertaken vice president gore attorney general reno did not qonsider very critical piece evidence written man named strauss who had attended the meetings the strauss memo contained the notation certain percentage hard money and certain percentage soft money attorney general reno did not consider that because she testified did not refresh the recollection strauss well there are number exceptions the hearsay rule one when piece paper reviewed witness and refreshes his prior recollection and another when the witness testifies that the notes were made contemporaneously with the discussion and constitutes prior recollection recorded which exception the hearsay rule and the witness does not have remember what had occurred that critical piece evidence was not considered attorney general reno here again are issues which are appropriate for inquiry the character issue the issue whether holder will exercise sufficient independence vice president gore sought explain the fbi that was out the room good bit the time the discussion because had put had consumed lot iced tea that occasion well these are matters which the independent counsel statute was designed deal with conduct further investigation consider all the ramifications and not show favoritism because the subject investigation happened the vice president the united states holders role advising the attorney general that matter his role deputy attorney general appropriate matter for inquiry the third issue inquired into involves the hearings the socalled faln organization the armed forces puerto rican nationalists the faln was organization linked over bombings threats kidnappings and other events which resulted the deaths least six people and the injuries many more between and four the persons who received clemency were convicted involvement the million armed robbery wells fargo office the face this kind conduct and the face report the pardon attorney the department justice the actions deputy attorney general holder were very extensive what eventuated the granting clemency the department justice sent the matter back for another evaluation apparently dissatisfied with the recommendation the pardon attorney that the clemency application ought denied this second occasion according press accounts the submission the pardon attorney made specific recommendation regarding clemency but did reflect that the fbi and two attorneys offices opposed clemency notwithstanding that record clemency was granted appropriate matter for inquiry see specifically what role holder played senator hatch who was the chairman the committee that time had this say about the conclusion president clinton who this point had only commuted three sentences offered clemency members faln this and really almost every member congress was shocking senator leahy joined the criticism the grant and raised the question about the failure the department justice contact the victims the matter came before the senate which rejected and criticized the grant the clemency vote all these matters relate judgment and relate whether holder had the kind resoluteness displayed attorney general griffin bell attorney general elliot richardson say his superior raising these concerns raising questions will approach these hearings next weeka week from thursdaywith open mind give holder opportunity explain his conduct and his actions and see the totality the record displays the requisite character and judgment and can justify the actions these sorts matters which would warrant the confidence the judiciary committee really representing the confidence the american people after our experience with attorney general gonzales and given the experience other attorneys general the past and the very critical role which they play upholding the rule law these are the gorts issues which ought aired holder ought have his day court speakthe hearing before the judiciary committeeto see can state the case which would warrant his confirmation president ask unanimous consent that

arlington and washington you are not talking about large land mass you are talking about very narrow tight area would similar south carolina and georgia lobbing missiles back and forth what would happen one those states did would immediately react protect our citizens and protect their lives and their livelihoods that what israel doing pray every night that somehow and some way can catalyst for ultimately lasting peace the middle east but surrendering terrorism the acts terrorism such hamas has been taking out the israeli people way support the nation israel believe they are doing the right thing confront headon the terror that has been imposed them should not lost any that the supplies that have gotten into gaza through what known the eisenhower passageway which from egypt into gaza have been military materials being flown and then taken through tunnels basically operatives iran just what happened lebanon year ago with hezbollah and the lebanese the same thing happening

president would order for before begin remarks compliment the presiding officer for his nomination cabinet secretary the secretary the interior and wish him very well before the senate being confirmed and serving that position guess that question doesnt need response certainly hope line for able say that
president hopeand joined here senator liebermanthat the senate will have opportunity consider before this week out resolution believe has been drafted the majority leader and the minority leader that deals with the ongoing war the gaza strip and that believe needs express the will the senate believe well that similar resolution wduld voted the house representatives express will the house then the whole worldand certainly the administrationwould know this bodys strong support for the state israel and our support for the actions israel taking right now hope that vote can occur before this week out wish commend senator lieberman for his considerable leadership this issue support this resolution the first thing the resolution does remind people why the state israel had act last february trip the middle east visited the israeli town sderot which about miles from the border gaza and learned from the towns mayor the toll taken the residents this town and neighboring cities from more than years rocket attacks the hamas terrorists the police station saw rack after rack these spent rockets the remains the rockets that had been launched hamas against the civilian population this city infact about minutes after departed the city one these hamas launched qassam rocketidentical the hundreds had seen the police statiodwhich fell israeli home town destroying thankfully one that attack was harmed there any doubt that the united states were suffering attack from just across the border similar this that wouldnt react stop that from happening think there question that would act stop this terrorism our hope that the resolution would express our acknowledgment that nation has the right defend itself that israel has had respond this more than rocket and mortar attacks its citizens since fully withdrew from gaza the year fact this town has been suffering for over years from these attacks the second point the resolution makes that there equivalency between the actions hamas and israel this case israel conducts its military operations spare innocent life they have specifically targeted hamas command centers and security installations and rocketlaunching sites weapons stockpiles and weapons smuggling tunnels they have tried very hard avoid civilian casualties fact israel has transmitted very specific warnings gazans they have dropped leaflets and made phofie calls targeted areas warn citizens leave because attack imminent this course even means they lose the element surprise and potentially put the lives israeli soldiers risk but israel believes important where possible avoid jeopardizing innocent lifequite the opposite from hamas which deliberately and cynically fires rockets from civilian areas make more difficult for israel target the terrorists and increase the likelihood civilian casualties when israel does take action hamas has ignored plea secretary general ban kimoon april that civilian areas gaza should not used base from which launch its actions against israel dozens mosques gaza have been turned into weapons storage facilities and hamas command centers fact airstrike mosque the tel hawa neighborhood gaza city last wednesday set off numerous secondary explosions caused the arms that had been stockpiled the mosque finally hamas openly admits that uses women and children human shields leading member hamas told aiaqsa february for the palestinian people death has become industry this why they have formed human shields the women the children the elderly and the mujahedeen order challenge the zionist bombing machine while targeting terrorists israel works avoid humanitarian crisis for ordinary gazans well during the first week israels operations facilitated the delivery gaza trucks loaded with more than tons food and medicine this not easy when you are the middle military operations ten ambulances and two thousand blood units were transferred gaza just that week more than palestinians have entered egypt for treatment addition dozen more who have entered israel january more than gallons industrial diesel fuel and gasoline for vehicles was transferred into gaza from fuel depot israel the way that fuel depot comes under constant attack from terrorists gaza does the place where the electricity generated for gaza which course makes absolutely sense finally this resolution speaks calls for ceasefire many voices the socalled international community have been heard preading for immediate ceasefire although think instructive that one never hears those voices condemning rocket attacks hamas terrorists believe the path hilt the violence clear ceasefire appropriate and when durable and sustainabld ceasefire the other hand that would allow hamas rearm and rebuild its support gaza course not acceptable hamas cannot given ceasefire that only serves provide breathing room regroup and then month months months from now start firing its rockets and missiles again the united nations could play constructive role but must resist the temptation that all too often falls into and that that moral equivalency point the press statement the security council december which among other things said the parties should stop immediately all military activities this dangerous moral equivalency only one party the violence carries out military activities the other partyhamasterrorizes and murders innocent people that why the only security council resolution that could acceptable this situationand say this with the understanding that the security council meeting meet here todayis one that affirms israels right defend itself and calls hamas immediately stop its terrorist activity add that security council resolution should look all those who support hamasprimarily and most significantly iran for years iran has been the source money trainingincluding training the facilities the islamic revolutionary guard corps iran itselfand weapons hamas hamass relationship with iran close that the egyptian president said this past may that hamas rule gaza means that egypt has border with iran since israel launched its military operation against hamas iran has announced steppedup arms shipments senior iranian clerics have organized recruiting drives send iranians hamass aid just yesterday senior iranian cleric announced that had recruited iranians join the cause hamas yet the international community has taken action counter irans support hamas terrorists security council resolution sanctioning iran for its assistance hamas would send important message and would good place start would unilateral sanctions the united states let conclude quoting the washington post columnist charles krauthammer who recently wrote one the most precise and succinct observations the situation gaza that have read wrote some geopolitical conflicts are morally complicated the israelgaza war not possesses moral clarity not only rare but excruciating the reidmcconnell resolution expect introduced shortly will important reaffirmation the bond between israel and the united states one forged the basis common values and the tragically shared experience terrorism passing this resolution are saying the israeli people stand with you and support you defending yourselves against terrorist attacks
president ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call rescinded
president would like recognized for period time the majority leader has been very gracious offer opportunity have some discussions about some amendments that going possibly allow bill that going introduce this evening wanted take some time now rather than later that would not keep staff here and that way could efficient with our time want talk about several things want preface with statement that have been very pleased see man respect great deal even though notin office yet but the presidentelect very firm the principles outlined ran for president and now about sworn into that office one the themes that has characterized his campaign and has characterized him ever since have known him has been the idea hope and change like many other americans look forward great anticipation the leadership that will brought forth the next few weeks and what that means the millions americans who are going look washington this month with level hope and excitement that have not seen this country decades while most the attention going focused the white house the institution the other end pennsylvania avenue this congress will arguable have greater role determining whether presidentelect obamas invocation change remembered election slogan true new era american politics hope and prayer new era while many commentators have noted with some justification the concepts such hope and change were never defined much and were not given specificity during the campaign believe the american people have already defined those concepts very clearly their hearts and minds believe what hope change and optimism represent the average voter very simple real expectation that washington will different voters have not undergone ideological jaduary shift nearly much they are demanding that government more competent that more mature that less corrupt and that less selfish that last part one the things that has driven things that are not very good the concept selfpromotion the concept promoting ones career the expense our country believe what both parties congress must and very quickly ask themselves the hard question why congress has historic low approval rating percent why have approval rating percent that according recent rasmussen poll both parties are accustomed analyzing what they and the other party did right wrong recent election cycles but yet neither party has come terms with the fundamental public rejection how congress institution has governed and behaved recent decades many respects the american people understand far better than understand ourselves while politicians tend believe the public put off ideologic debate what alienates voters the truly debilitating division congress between statesmen and those who view reelection the ultimate goal careerism not driven any set ideas but pure parochialism and the shortterm pursuit power for powers sake the real division then that blocks progress and commonsense solutions not between ideas parties but between every members selfpromoted interests the american people understand this intuitively which why congress has had historic low approval ratings long before entered this recession what the public knows that congress that debates ideas tends develop the best solutions while congress that driven careerism and parochialism builds bridges nowhere and fails conduct oversight over entities like fannie mae and freddie mac short the american people can handle serious debate but they cannot handle incompetence corruption stupidity and selfinterest put above that the nation congresss handling economic stimulus bill will doubt early test although the policy may suspect congress seems willing try avoid embarrassing the new president turning the package into orgy parochial porkbarrel spending said today there will earmarks the stimulus package congresss real test though will come next and will repeated hundreds times over the next years with each piece legislation far congress has signaled little desire for longterm commitment change some would ask why would say that would say that because here little while this evening are going reintroduce bill that nobody knows right now how many other bills has itthat going the firt order business this congressthat allocates billion some some very worthy projects but tons that money projects that not have priority anywhere close what ought doing this anomnibus lands bill that indulges the worst habits parochial congress the bill which holdover from the last congress includes such things million road nowhere through wildlife refuge billion water project billiondesigned assure that salmon will repopulated does not take long divide salmon into billion see that what have million salmon they are worth more than gold there million give the city augustine they can prepare celebration years from now recognize their birthday hardly see the midst the economic times face how that can priority for the nation whole know priority from parochial standpoint but the best interest the nation has been claimed that this bill noncontroversial and should pass essentially without amendment without debate however note that over different organizations both the left side the political spectrum and the right side the political spectrum are opposed this bill because controversial point noted the nonpartisan congressional research service the earmarks this bill have angered many groups has the significant antienergy more foreign dependence oil programs that are this bill this bill contains provision that will eliminate trillion cubic feet known natural gas reserves proven reserves today that will not able take for our consumption what that means are going import trillion feet natural gas because are going say you cannothave this also contains million barrels proven oil that are longer going take just went from oil oil today have learned anything ought about much energy selfsufficiency can the controversy over whether get off fossil fuels debate for another time but one can deny the necessity discontinuing sending our fortunes countries that are supplying oil and are also ultimately our enemies the energy resources walled off this bill will match the annual production levels our two largest natural gasproducing states alaska and texas worry about bringing this billand again thankful the majority leader has reached out that might able offer amendmentsis what does this send signal the american public here what sends says there may change the white house but there absolutely change congress why would bring bill thatis going spend billion our moneyat least billion that not priority interms the priorities facing this nationwhy would bring that the floor the first order business the congress the only reason could bringing the floor because makes look good home with multiple parochial projects our country has failing that will cripple forever the fact that have allowed parochialism not the oath saw all new members and newly reelected members take today where uphold the constitution what uphold the future our own political careers history interesting the republican revolution unraveled not because they made lot big mistakessome were madebut because republicans made ton little mistakes they didnt realize they were making the new and expanded majority will realize that with greater numbers comes greater share the responsibility and blame for whatever happens this country back that percent approval rating has with this congress dont believe you are going every turn every opportunity what the best longterm interests for this nation and are going prove because this bill ultimately will probably pass out this chamber and passed and are going spend time when are going have trillion deficit this year another billion trying stimulate the economy are going say priority doesnt matter but parochialism does looking good home matters more than the longterm interests the country matters more than the financial future our grandchildrenmy political career party the historical basis our country built sacrifice built sacrifice one generation for the generations that follow our political history used that well worry concern cant live the hope and the change the presidentelect has set before bringing this bill the floor the first order business the congress have confirmed the american public that business usual businese usual that dont recognize the severity the situation find ourselves that are not going change our habits that will continue promote those things that promote rather than promote the longterm good and benefit the country pure selfishness saying what want and what need and political future state has come above the longterm interests and the best interests this wonderful country the real challenge doesnt come from any the parties comes from parochialism the public has told congress time start acting the best interest the country rather than the best interest our next election the january sooner congress realizes change requires cultural shift both partees the sooner that change will come would like spend moment outlining few components this bill have not actually gotten see the bill but have been told the majority leader that have added think other bills but from what have known the past let through and explain the american public what this bill the national parks today face severe shortage money maintain them their current level about billion this bill add four new national parks the arizona memorial hawaii sinking the visitors center sinking havent put the money repair but yet are going create more national parks that will further dilute the main tenance budget the national park service cant even maintain what have have million backlog just the national mall washington didnt address any that terms the priority fixing that yet are going add four new national parks are going add new heritage areas great for protect and think about the environment but never talk about how that impacts property rights one the rights given our nation was created are going threaten that area are going threaten through eminent domain are going threaten through councils that will impact individual ownership what you can with your own property because you might proximity heritage area have studies that would create expand future national parks other words more that what are funding this bill dont have the money take care the parks have today but yet are going put into this and spend money potentially create more there are provisions this bill that will totally prohibit any exploration oil extraction coal extraction natural gas extraction from million acres this country many which have proven reserves underlying there are rivers that are designated portions which are designated scenic rivers have great scenic river oklahoma called the illinois glad scenic river but with scenic river designation comes trampling the rights people who are far away from didnt change scenic rivers designation light our energy needs once river designated scenic river and need move natural gas coal slurry oil from point point are totally prohibited from ever doing that scenic river another strike any sort increasing our independence energy because are going designate scenic rivers why not designate scenic rivers with option make sure dont handcuff ourselves when comes energy

president the congress begins the most important item our agenda help end the worst economic crisis america has faced since the great depression look forward working with colleagues the senate develop and approve economic turnaround package quickly possible but even congress authorizes much trillion new government spending over the next years stimulate the economy dont address the origins this crisis fear the impact any recovery package will dampened this economic crisis began with the bubble that burst the housing market have address that first and foremost families need able stay their homes and communities need stabilized before the economy can start grow again thats why first bill the new congress reintroducing the helping families save their homes bankruptcy act when first began working this bill almost two years ago the center for responsible lending credit suisse and others estimated that million homes were risk foreclosure the mortgage bankers association and the rest the mortgage industry scoffed such number last month credit suisse estimated that million homes are likely lost foreclosure the economy continues worsen they believe foreclosures will exceed million homes over million familiesrepresenting percent all mortgagesare losing their homes our economy not going recover first introduced this bill september have chaired three hearings the subject and tried three times pass this legislation last year large coalition supports this billincluding the aarp the consumer federation america the leadership conference civil rights the aflcio the center for responsible lending the national association consumer bankruptcy attorneys and many others but the mortgage bankers association and the rest the mortgage industry have successfully opposed far three things have fundamentally changed and back pressing even harder that make this bill law first the banks that brought the reckless lending dense securitization and risky investing practices that created the boom and bust the housing market have now happily accepted billion handout from the american taxpayers even most them refuse help the homeowners who are suffering most acutely from their irresponsible business practices frankly think that the credibility the opposition bill has slipped just bit second painfully clear that foreclosure mitigation efforts date have failed professor alan white the valparaiso school law analyzed large sample the mortgage modifications made voluntarily the industryled hope now alliance found that almost half these socalled foreclosure prevention plans actually increased the monthly payments homeowners how does that help families save their homes third america soon will have president who understands the enormity this problem and supports this change the bankruptcy code what does this bill this bill would allow mortgages primary residences modified bankruptcy just like other debtsincluding vacation homes family farms and yachts only families living the home would qualifyno speculators are allowed the bill would allow judges cut through all the constraints that have doomed foreclosure prevention plans from being successful for even the most proactive and wellintentioned mortgage servicers there are very real constraints some the current efforts prevent foreclosure today because most mortgages are sliced and sold different investors servicers sometimes have hard time locating all the owners the mortgages get their consent for modifications servicers that modify mortgages without the consent all the investors fear that they could sued some investors refuse approve sensible restructurings because there little incentive for the owner second mortgage approve modification first mortgage that will see the second mortgage wiped out mortgage modifications that ignore the other pile debt household facing setup for failure thats leading reason why see many redefaults newly modified mortgages through the current programs finally servicers who are the front lines answering the phone calls from homeowners and processing the paperwork often are compensated more for foreclosures than modifications proposal would allow judges cut through these complicating factors rework the underlying loans the mortgages that are modified bankruptcy will provide far more value the lenders and the investors than foreclosure the bill would provide borrowers who are frustrated with their mortgage servicers some desperately needed leverage get their bankers full attention provides incentive for banks modify loans before the judges bankruptcy for them best all this program would cost the taxpayers nothing given the staggering amounts that taxpayers have been asked give the mortgage industry lately the taxpayers are ready for plan that doesnt cost them anything and that will actually work since the mortgage bankers association still opposes this plan after taking all that taxpayer money and after failing anything meaningful their own address this crisis want address their primary remaining objection this plan clearly possible that everyone listening fully understands why the industry wrong once and for all few weeks ago the chairman the mortgage bankers association testified the senate judiciary committee that bill would create tax per month for every homeowner america forever asked the hearing and staff asked three times after the hearing for some shred evidence support such ridiculous claim the response finally came just before the holidays and laughable the mortgage bankers association claims that changing the bankruptcy code will create new costs for lenders that must then passed all borrowers they have concocted list individual costs that add the full tax they call but they dont provide single shred evidence support any these cost estimates not one they just made them all the other hand study conducted adam levitin the georgetown law school uses actual statistical data show that there virtually impact mortgage interest rates just because mortgages can modified judges bankruptcy the main problem with the argument that bill will increase future mortgage rates this the choice for mortgage lenders and investors not full payment the original mortgage versus lower payment from judicially modified mortgage the choice between lower payment from judicially modified mortgage and mortgage failure valparaisos professor white reports that his large study sample mortgage servicers and their investors lost average percent the value the mortgages that failed through foreclosure about per loan those loans would have been modified bankruptcy the servicers and investors would have been given ownership sustainable mortgage worth least the fair market value the home plus interest rate that included premium for risk these modified mortgages would average have created far better results than the foreclosures that actually occurred therefore when the mortgage bankers association claims with evidence whatsoever that bill would raise mortgage interest rates should all ask them this why would mortgage bankers charge future borrowers higher interest rates tomorrow because change the law that helps the bankers reduce their losses today urge the senate move swiftly enact the economic recovery package that america desperately needs and part that effort urge colleagues support the remedy the foreclosure crisis that will provide the most help the million families across the country who are risk losing their homes dont address the core the crisis ifear that the stimulus may not work well should look forward working with chairman dodd senator schumer all the other senators who have supported this provision and presidentelect obama see that signed into law quickly

president today introducing the credit card minimum payment notification act this bill would help american consumers requiring banks notify credit card holders the true cost slo they choose make the minimum payment each month americans today own more credit cards than ever before the average american has approximately four credit cards americans held more than cards unsurprisingly this increase credit card ownership has resulted dramatic increase credit card debt over the past decades americans combined credit card debt has nearly tripledfrom billion staggering billion today the average american household has approximately credit card debt percent from among credit card users percent carry balance their credit card percent increase from last year approximately families with credit cards pays only the minimum due every month young americans are using credit cards finance everything from daily expenses college tuition fortyone percent college students have credit card and those only percent pay their bills full every month over the past year economic conditions have worsened has become even harder for families pay off their debt whether mortgage tuition medical expenses people are finding harder than ever meet all their expenses july this year percent people surveyed reported that their ability pay off their credit card balances has become more strained this increasing debt contributing more and more americans filing for bankruptcy ever since the bankruptcy reform act was enacted nonbusiness bankruptcies have been increasing rapid pace the numbers this year already show staggering hike between september and september americans filed over one million nonbusiness bankruptcies percent from the previous year many these personal bankruptcies are people who are turning credit cards finance their expenses todays filers have even more credit card debt than usual sometimes because they have been struggling pay mortgage and have started using credit cards for daily expenses one family the forsyths found themselves financial trouble after moving new state for better job opportunity unable sell their old house they rented but when the renter stopped making payments the family became overwhelmed with two mortgage payments credit cards helped firstproviding payment for food utilities and clothes but the family quickly accumulated debt and was left with alternative other than bankruptcy the benefits offered credit cards are attractive but these cards also pose enormous financial risk dianne mcleod discovered this painful way after backtoback medical emergencies depleted her finances although credit cards initially enabled her maintain her lifestyle before long these cards and two mortgages meant that she later found that she was spending more than percent her monthly income interest payments addition thousands dollars annually fees today credit cardholders receive information the impact carrying balance with compounding interest result too often individuals make only the minimum payment after few years they find that the interest the debt almost twice the amount their original purchases and they not know what about first introduced the credit card minimum payment notification act during the debate the bankruptcy bill said then believe the billfailed balance responsibility and fairness consumers should not harshly penalized when they not have the basic tools and information they need make informed choices the credit card minimum payment notification act would help prevent this problem requiring credit card companies add two items each consumers monthly credit card statement general notice that would read making only the minimum payment will increase the interest you and the time takes repay your balance individualized notice edit card holders that specifies clearlj their bill how much time will take repay their debt and the total amount they will pay they only mfiake the minimum payments foqr consumers with variable rate cards the bill would also require companies provide tollfree number where cardlolders can access creditcounseling services the disclosure requirements the bill would only apply the consumer has minimum payment that less than percent the debt the credit card otherwise none these disclosures would required their statement last year gallupexperian poll found that about percent credit cardholders consistently make only the minimum payment their cards each month consider what this could mean for the average household for example the average credit card debt the average fixed credit card interest rate approximately percent the percent minimum payment all that paid its debt each month would take more than years pay off the bill and the total cost would and thats just the minimum assuming that the family didnt ever charge another dime that bill other words the family would need pay interest just repay original debt for individuals families with more than average debt the pitfalls are even greater credit card debt the average percent interest rate will take over years and more than pay off only the minimum payments are made twelve percent relatively low average interest rate interest rates around percent are not uncommon credit cards and penalty interest rates can reach high percent family that has the average debt with percent interest rate and makes the minimum payments will need lifetime over yearsand pay off the initial bill thats just interestan amount that approaches times the original debt credit cards are important part everyday life and they help the economy operate more smoothly giving consumers and merchants reliable convenient way exchange funds but the bottom line that for many consumers the two percent minimum payment financial trap the credit card minimum payment notification act designed ensure that people are not caught this trap through lack information last month the federal reserve board approved new rules that will improve disclosures but the rules not far enough under the rules starting july credit card companies will have warn consumers about the effect making minimum payments the length time will take pay off their balances but the warnings may only examples and will not show the effect the amount that consumers pay over time before approving the final rules the federal reserve board interviewed consumers who typically carried credit card balances those consumers found disclosures most helpful when they provided specific information and included warnings about the amount that would have paid over time the credit card minimum payment notification act would provide the straightforward disclosure that consumers find most helpful and most effective this disclosure will ensure that consumers know exactly what means for them carry balance and make minimum payments they can make informed decisions credit card use and repayment addition the burden banks will minimal calculations like these are purely formulaic credit card companies already complete similar calculations determine credit risk and when they tell consumers what their required minimum payment each month the harsh effects the bankruptcy bill are becoming apparent during the debate over that bill had hoped that congress would succeed balancing the need incentivize consumers act responsibly with the promise fresh start for those who fell impossibly behind not believe that that balance was reached continue believe that consumers need meaningful disclosure informing them the effects making minimum payments today americans face increasing struggles with debt and expenses the bill needed more than ever urge colleagues support this legislation president ask unanimous consent that the text the bill printed the record

today introducing the lawful interrogation and detention act legislation intended reverse the harmful dangerous unamerican and illegal detention and interrogation practices the past seven years will describe detail below the four provisions this bill would close the guantanamo bay detention centers outlaw cias coercive interrogation program prevent the use contractor interrogations and end secret detention cia black sites these practices have brought shame our nation have harmed our ability fight the war terror and believe violate law and international treaty obligations was made crystal clear last november need change and need new direction when comes the war terrorism need disavow the dark side embraced the bush administration instead need follow our approach honed through the cold war standing the strength our values and ideals building strong partnerships with allies and mixing soft power with the force our military might this legislation would put back the right track and believe fully consistent with the policies and intentions presidentelect obama time end the failed experiment guantanamo bay time repudiate torture and secret disappearances time end the outsourcing coercive interrogations outside mercenaries time return the norms and values that have driven the united states greatness since the days george washington but have been tarnished the past years first this legislation requires the president close the detention facilities guantanamo bay within months the need close guantanamo clear along with the abuses abu ghraib guantanamo has been decried american hypocrisy and cruelty throughout the world they have given aid recruiting our enemies and have been named navy general counsel alberto mora the leading causes death troops iraq numerous reports most recently one completed and approved unanimously the senate armed services committee have documented the abusive methods used guantanamo beyond the physical psychological and emotional abuse witnessed guantanamo has been the source great legal embarrassment the supreme court has struck down the bush administrations legal reasoning four separate times the rasul hamdi hamdan and boumediene decisions was explicitly created separate and lesser system justice hold people captured near the battlefield afghanistan indefinitely has produced exactly three convictions including australian david hicks who agreed plea bargain get off the island and osama bin ladins driver salim hamdan who has already served almost all his sentence through time already spent guantanamo the hard part about closing guantanamo not deciding figuring out what with the remaining detainees under the lawful interrogation and detention act the approximately individuals now being held there would handled one five ways they could charged with crime and tried the united states the federal civilian military justice systems these systems have handled terrorists and other dangerous individuals before and are capable dealing with classified evidence and other unusual factors individuals could transferred international tribunal hold hearings such tribunal created detainees could returned their native countries that not possible they could transferred third country date more than men have been sent from guantanamo the custody other countries recently portugal and other nations have suggested they would open taking some the remaining detainees way help close guantanamo there are detainees who canti charged with crimes transferred the custody another country there fourth option the secretary defense and the director national intelligence agree that individual poses security threat the united states the government may release him this may work for example for the chinese uighurs remaining guantanamo fact federal court has already ordered that this group released into the country though that ruling has been stayed upon appeal finally for detainees who cannot addressed any the first four options the executive branch could hold them under the existing authorities provided the law armed conflict believe that these options provide sufficient flexibility handle the people now being held guantanamo the incoming obama administration decides that other alternatives are needed should come congress explain the specifics the problem and will work toward joint legislative solution the other three provisions this legislation end parts the cias secret detention and interrogation program some the details the program are already publicly known like the use waterboarding three individuals other aspects remain secret such the other authorized interrogation techniques and how they were used there have been public allegations multiple deaths detainees cia custody there was one conviction cia contractor the death detainee afghanistan but other details remain classified but well known that august the justice department approved coercive interrogation techniques including waterboarding for the cias use this despite the fact that the justice department has prosecuted the use waterboarding and the state department has decried overseas the administration used warped logic and faulty reasoning say waterboarding technique was not torture other interrogation techniques used the cia have not been acknowledged but are still authorized for use this has end but will never turn this sad page our nations history until all coercive techniques are banned and are replaced with single clear uniform standard across the united states government that standard established this legislation the interrogation protocols set out the army field manual the specified techniques work for the military and operate under the same framework the timehonored approach the federal bureau investigation the cia would abide its terms would work for the cia well these techniques were the heart former fbi special agent jack cloonans successful interrogation those responsible for the world trade center bombing they were also the tools used special agent george piro get saddam hussein provide the evidence that resulted his death sentence have powerful expert testimony that the army field manual techniques work against terrorist suspects the manuals use across the government supported scores retired generals and admirals general david petraeus and former secretaries state and national security advisors both parties majorities both houses congress passed this provision last year part the fiscal year intelligence authorization bill sending clear message that not support coercive interrogatlions regrettably the presidents veto stopped from becoming law the new president agrees that need end coercive interrogations and comply strictly the terms the convention against torture and the geneva conventions look forward working with him end this sad story the nations history the third part this legislation ban contractor interrogators the cia general hayden has testified the cia hires and keeps contract people who are not intelligence professionals and whose sole job break detainees and get them talk firmly believe that outsourcing interrogations whether coercive more appropriate ones private companies way diminish accountability and avoid getting the agencys hands dirty also believe that the use contractors leads more brutal interrogations than they were done government employees there are surely areas where paying contractors makes practical and financial sense interrogationsa form collecting intelligenceis not one them this has become major diplomatic issue key obstacle prosecuting people like abu zubaydah and khalid shaykh mohammed and national black eye not the sort thing done arms length the fourth and final provision this legislation requires that the cia and other intelligence agencies provide notification the international committee the red crosg the icrcof their detainees following notification the cia will required provide icrc officials with access their detainees the same way that the military does access the icrc hallmark international law and required the geneva conventions access third party and the icrc particular was seen the guarantee that american men and women would protected they were ever captured overseas but icrc access has been denied cia black sites just like had been some militaryrun facilities the war terror this has part opened the door the abuses detainee treatment independent access prevents abuses like witnessed abu ghraib and guantanamo bay time that the same protection place for the cia has been demanded the department defense remain nation war and credible actionable intelligence remains cornerstone our war effort but this war that will won fighting smarter not sinking the depths our enemies our nation has paid enormous price because these interrogations they cast shadow and doubt over our ideals and our system justice our enemies have used our practices recruit more extremists our key global partnerships crucial winning the war terror have been strained will take time resume our place the worlds beacon liberty and justice this bill will put that path and start the process

president rise today introduce legislation essential consumers receiving the best prices every product from electronics clothing groceries bill the discount pricing consumer protection act will restore the nearly century old rule that illegal under antitrust law for manufacturer set minimum price below which retailer cannot sell the manufacturers product practice known resale price maintenance vertical price fixing june overturning yearold precedent narrow supreme court majority the leegin case incorrectly interpreted the sherman act overturn this basic rule the marketplace which has served consumers well for nearly century billidentical legislation introduced the congress will correct this misinterpretation antitrust law and restore the per ban vertical price fixing our bill has been endorsed state attorneys general well numerous antitrust experts including former ftc chairman pitofsky and current ftc commissioner harbour the reasons for this legislation are compelling allowing manufacturers set minimum retail prices will threaten the very existence discounting and discount stores and lead higher prices for consumers for nearly century the rule against vertical price fixing permitted discounters sell goods the most competitive price many credit this rule with the rise todays low price discount retail giantsstores like target best buy walmart and the internet sites amazon and ebay which offer consumers wide array highly desired products discount prices from own personal experience business know the dangers permitting vertical price fixing family started the kohls department stores and worked there for many years before sold the stores the several occasions lost lines merchandise because tried sell prices lower than what the manufacturer and our rival retailers wanted for example when started kohls and were just small competitor the established retail giants had serious difficulties obtaining the leading brand name jeans the traditional department stores demanded that the manufacturer not sell unless would agree maintain certain minimum price because they didnt want lose the business their biggest customers that jeans manufacturer acquiesced the demands the department storesat least until our lawyers told them that they were violating the rule against vertical price fixing know firsthand the dangers competition and discounting permitting the practice vertical price fixing but dont need rely own experience for nearly years until when congress passed the consumer goods pricing act federal law permitted states enact socalled fair trade laws legalizing vertical price fixing studies department justice conducted the late indicated that prices were between percent higher the states that allowed vertical price fixing than the states that had not passed such fair trade laws costing consumers least billion per year that time given the tremendous economic growth the intervening decades the likely harm consumers vertical price fixing were permitted even grater today his dissenting opinion the leegin case justice breyer estimated that only percent ofmanufacturers engaged vertical price fixing the volume commerce affected today would billion translating into retail bills that would average higher for the average family four every year and the experience the last year and half since the leegin decision beginning confirm our fears regarding the dangers from permitting vertical price fixing december for example sony announced that would implement nodiscount rule retailers selling some its most indemand products including some models highend flat screen tvs and digital cameras december the wall street journal reported that new business has materialized for companies that scour the internet search retailers selling products bargain when such bargain sellers are detected the manufacturer alerted that they can demand the seller end the discounting its product the chilling effect discounting such tactics clearin one example the wall street journal reported that circuit city was forced raise its retail price for flat screen nearly after its discount price was discovered the internet defenders the leegin decision argue that todays giant retailers such walmart best buy target can take care themselves and have sufficient market power fight manufacturer efforts impose retail prices whatever the merits that argument particularly worried about the effect this new rule permitting minimum vertical price fixing the next generation discount retailers new discount retailers can prevented from selling products discount the behest established retailer worried about the competition will imperil essential element retail competition beneficial consumers overturning the per ban vertical price fixing the supreme court leegin announced this practice should instead evaluated under what known the rule reason under the rule reason business practice illegal only imposes unreasonable restraint competition the burden the party challenging the practice prove court that the anticompetitive effects the practice outweigh its justifications the words the supreme court the party challenging the practice must establish the restraints history nature and effect whether the businesses involved possess market power further significant consideration under the rule reason short establishing that any specific example vertical price fixing violates the rule reason onerous and difficult burden for plaintiff antitrust case parties complaining about vertical price fixing are likely small discount stores with limited resources engage lengthy and complicated antitrust litigation these plaintiffs are unlikely possess the facts necessary make the extensive showing necessary prove case under the rule reason the words ftc commissioner pamela jones harbour applying the rule reason vertical price fixing virtual euphemism for per legality july our antitrust subcommittee conducted extensive hearing into the leegin decision and the likely effects abolishing the ban vertical price fixing both former ftc chairman robert pitofsky and current ftc commissioner harbour strongly endorsed restoring the ban vertical price fixing marcy syms ceo the syms discount clothing stores did well citing the likely dangers the ability discounters such syms survive after abolition the rule against vertical price fixing syms also stated that would very unlikely for her bring antitrust suit challenging vertical price fixing under the rule reason because her company would not have the resources knowledge strong enough position the marketplace make such action prudent our examination this issue has produced compelling evidence for the continued necessity ban vertical price fixing protect discounting and low prices for consumers the discount pricing consumer protection act will accomplish this goal legislation quite simple and direct would simply add one sentence section the sherman actthe basic provision addressing combinations restraint tradea statement that any agreement with retailer wholesaler distributor setting price below which product service cannot sold violates the law balancing protracted legal proceedingswill necessary should manufacturer enter into such agreement will unquestionably violate antitrust law the uncertainty and legal impediments antitrust enforcement vertical price fixing will replaced simple and clear legal rulea legal rule that will promote low prices and discount competition the benefit consumers every day the last few decades millions consumers have benefited from explosion retail competition from new large discounters virtually every product from clothing electronics groceries both big box stores and the internet our legislation will correct the supreme courts abrupt change antitrust law and will ensure that todays vibrant competitive retail marketplace and the savings gained american consumers from discounting will not

president pleased today introduce the rural law enforcement assistance act bill designed help rural communities deal with growing crime problems that threaten become significantly worse result the devastating economic crisis face congress and the new administration are beginning this session focused passing stimulus bill that will provide hundreds billions dollars restart our economy create jobs and reverse the economic downturn inherited from the bush administration the bush administrition has already provided hundreds billions dollars rescue the financial industry and president bush released billions more for assistance the auto industry despite our legislative efforts protect jobs and the economy whole little has been done help the millions people rural america who have been hit hard anyone the devastating effects this recession must help rural communities stay safe during this economic downturn rural areas which lack the crime prevention and law enforcement resources often available larger communities have particular need for assistance combat the worsening drug and crime problems that threaten the wellbeing our small cities and towns and most particularly our young people the rural law enforcement assistance act will provide just this kind help this bill will reauthorize rural law enforcement assistance program first passed congress the early like many valuable programs that help local law enforcement and crime prevention funding for this program was allowed lapse under the bush administration despite its effectiveness contributing the record drop crime the late the program would authorize million year over the next years new byrne grant funds for state and local law enforcement specifically for rural states and rural areas within larger states this support would used hire police officers purchase necessary police equipment and promote the use task forces and collaborative efforts with federal law enforcement just important these funds would also used for prevention and treatment programs rural communities programs that are necessary combat crime and are too often the first programs cut economic downturn this bill also authorizes fnillion year over years for specialized training for rural law enforcement officers since training another area often cut hard times this bill will immediately help cashstrapped rural communities with the law enforcement assistance they desperately need december the senate judiciary committee traveled albans vermont hear from the people that resilient community about the growing problem drugrelated crime rural america and about the innovative steps they are taking combat that scourge the introduction this bill step forward apply the lessons learned that hearing and previous crime hearings vermont and elsewhere crime not just big city issue heard albans last month and hearing rutland vermont earlier last year the drugs and violence long seen largely urban areas now plague even our most rural and remote communitibs well the world grows smaller with better transportation and faster communication our shared problems rural communities also face the added burden fighting these crime problems without the sophisticated task forces and specialized squads common big cities and metropolitan areas fact too many rural communities whether vermont other rural states dont have the money for local police force all and rely almost exclusively the state police other statewide agencies for even basic police services this environment must more provide assistance those rural communities most risk and hardest hit the economic crisis unfortunately for the last years throughout the country state and local law enforcement agencies have been stretched thin they shoulder both traditional crimefighting duties and new homeland security demands they have faced continuous cuts federal funding during the bush years and time and time again our state and local law enforcement officers have been unable fill vacancies and get the equipment they need this trend unacceptable and that why must restore funding for rural law enforcement that proved successful when crime fell record lows rural and urban areas alike former prosecutor have always advocated vigorous enforcement and punishment those who commit serious crimes but also know that punishment alone will not solve the problems drugs and violence our rural communities police chiefs from vermont and across the country have told that cannot arrest our way out this problem combating drug use and crime requires all the tools our

president did the last congress cosponsoring the legislation introduced today the senator from connecticut provide house seat for the district columbia and additional house seat for utah representation and suffrage are central the american system selfgovernment that americas founders warned that limiting suffrage would risk another revolution and could prevent ratification the constitution the supreme court has said that right more precious free country than having voice the election those who govern continue believe what stated more than years ago here the senate floor that americans living the district should enjoy all the privileges citizenship including voting rights the bill introduced today would treat the district columbia congressional district provide for full representation the house the bill states however that the district shall not treated state for representation this body matter how worthwhile even compelling objective might however cannot legislatively pursue without authority grounded the constitution would note that the constitution explicitly gives congress legislative authority over the district all cases whatsoever this authority unparalleled scope and has been called sweeping plenary and extraordinary the courts surpasses both the authority state legislature has over its own state and the authority congress has ovef legislation affecting the states some have argued that despite the centrality representation and suffrage and notwithstanding our unparalleled and plenary authority over the district that congress cannot provide house seat for the district legislation they base their argument single word article section the constitution provides that the house representatives shall composed members chosen the people the several states because the district not state the argument goes cannot have house seat without constitutional amendment studied this issue extensively and published analysis and conclusions the harvard journal legislation for everyone consider ask unanimous consent that this article made part the record following remarks let here just mention few considerations that found persuasive first have already mentioned the default position our system governmet representation and suffrage that principle fundamental that this case believe there must actual evidence that americas founders intended deny district residents such evidence exists second establishing and maintaining the district separate political jurisdiction does not require disenfranchising its residents the founders wanted the capital free from state control and support keeping that way giving the district house seat changes neither that status nor congress legislative authority over the district third americas founders not only did not intend disenfranchise district residents they demonstrated the opposite intention their own legislative actions congress provided legislation for americans living the land ceded for the district vote congressional elections one even suggested that this legislation was unconstitutional because that land was not part state congress could then congress can today fourth courts have held for more than two centuries that constitutional provisions framed terms states can applied the district that congress can legislatively accomplish for the district what the constitution accomplishes for states congress for example has authority regulate commerce among the several states the supreme court held that this applies the district opponents giving the district house seat believe congress cannot regulate commerce involving the district the original constitution provided that direct taxes shall apportioned among the several states the supreme court held that congress legislative authority over the district allows taxation the district opponents giving the district house seat believe that the district suitable for taxation but not for representation the constitution provides that federal courts may review lawsuits between citizens different states the supreme court held that congress can legislatively extend this the district even though the constitution does not the list goes involving provisions the constitution statues and even treaties over and over courts have ruled either that provisions framed terms states can directly applied the district that congress can legislatively perhaps opponents giving the district house seat believe that all these decisions over more than two centuries were wrong that the word states begins and ends the discussion every case they cannot say the present case without confronting those precedents these and other considerations which discussed the article mentioned have led conclude that the constitution allows congress legislatively provide house seat for the district want repeat continuing opposition district representation the senate the districts status nonstate jurisdiction not relevant representation the house which was designed represent people but relevant representation the senate which was designed represent states would once again emphasize that the bill introduced today explicitly disclaims senate representation for the district december signed letter the majority and minority leaders expressing the same position had taken three decades earlier stated that while there are many differences between utah and the district sure they share the right represented our countrys legislature take the same position today believing that congress may and should pass the bill introduced today provide for that representation

who maybe mile out town they cant get the internet costs them month they are going satellite they can stuck with dialup that slow they can hardly use you get understand the need for better technological infrastructure what finally figured out after this county touri had been trying figure out why some companies say they are offering internet service finally figured out what the problem many parts state they may have internet service but either much too slow much too expensive country have ensured that every american has access telephone service and electricity regardless economic status must now the same for broadband internet access broadband not only creates educational and health care opportunities can create opportunities for businesses and employment that would otherwise not exist rural communities these tough economic times broadband deployment creates jobsnot only the direct creation jobs the tech sector but also the creation even more indirect employment opportunities increasing access broadband after visiting minnesotas counties convened broadband roundtable state december heard firsthand from people about the importance making sure they have access fast and affordable broadband have had success stories our state well one story heard when was out small town minnesotasebekathey began diversifying early into cuttingedge technologies including fiber optic infrastructure digital telephone switching cable and satellite broadband internet service percent their customers they have very high percentagei think percentof people who are actually purchasing this highspeed internet very small town remote area minnesota the government carver county leading collaborative effort interconnect county facilities with cities school districts townships and other entities the development highspeed communications through number funding and technical assistance programs minnesotas blandin foundations broadband initiative has worked rural minnesota communities educate community leaders and get these partnerships started despite these local success stories however much more needs done the overall reality america has become international laggard broadband the united states ranked among nations surveyed broadband subscribership according the organization for economic cooperation and development today the united states the list the last years have gone from the world the world that not the kind progress that going keep this country moving and get back track according the international telecommunications union the united states now perched the world broadband penetration canada has higher level broadband penetration and digital opportunity than broadband adoption the united states does continue growfrom percent homes march percent april but the figure significantly lower for those living rural america only percent course have consider more than just access noted earlier need look speed need look speed are going compete with countries such india and japan have work ahead all understand broadband critical infrastructure for the century one estimateto give you sense what are talking about jobsevery percentage point increase broadband penetration per year would lead the creation nearly new jobs that why essential that all communities including our rural communities have the opportunity take advantage the opportunities offered this stcentury infrastructure want these jobs state going thief river falls lanesboro crookston instead going off other countries such japan and india that simple want these jobs stay the united states have seen the challenge before make sure our rural communities are not left behind technology develops for example there are still many americans who can remember growing homes with electricity and telephone service about percent all homes and towns and cities the united states had electricity but fewer than percent farms america had electricity and only about percent had telephone service which was often unreliable president roosevelt created the rural electrification administration rea the rea helped organize and support farmerowned electric cooperatives bring electricity farms this was from more than threequarters all farms america had electricity with those standards that were put place went from percent percent that amazing achievement during time crisis because people believed you could get this done the penetration telephone service actually took longer only percent americas farms had telephone service that year telephone amendment was added the rural electrification act which made loan funds available finance rural telephone systems just little more than decade nearly percent farms had telephone service even much our modern transportation infrastructureincluding paved roads and steel and concrete bridgeshas come into existence only the past years thanks both the new deal and president eisenhowers interstate highway program our broadband infrastructure presents with the same challenge make sure one left behind presidentelect obama understands that broadband must now considered basic part our national infrastructure also understands that investment our broadband infrastructure essential our longterm prosperity few weeks ago weekly address presidentelect obama announced that key part his economic recovery plan would involve increasing broadband deployment and adoption saying unacceptable that the united states ranks the world broadband adoption monday this week sent letter the presidentelect applauding his efforts include investment our nations information infrastructure part economic stimulus package also asked that consider these partnerships that have seen work well our state and that matching grants the federal level work with the local communities would one way spur broadband development finally asked him look the fact that this not just about communities that have access also about communities that have bad access slow access too expensive access really want get the broadband infrastructure place have make work for everyone just what dwight eisenhower did with the highway system the and just president roosevelt did with rural electrification the and believe any economic stimulus package must include mechanisms designed bring affordable and fast broadband this country economic stimulus package should fully fund the broadband data improvement act which cosponsored and which passed last congress any economic stimulus package mentioned must also fund matching grants for communitylevel partnerships that demonstrate strong cooperation among local governments businesses schools health care and others finally one aspect the nations information infrastructure that may continue elude absent some type federal involvement the creation advanced interoperable communications network for public safety still remember hearing when one our police officers was shot and killed paul how those who were trying apprehend the person the murderer this case were trying communicate when they were the helicopter they literally had have multiple walkie talkies and telephones sometimes six seven try match with all the phone systems that were use across the area well since then have had improvements the large metropolitan area the twin cities our interoperability but not have that kind matching and that kind cooperation the rural parts our state nor have across the country the first responsibility government protect its citizens the fact that our nations police fire and other first responders including those our rural areas still not have access such network more than years after the tragic events september simply unacceptable believe consideration this issue the context broadband stimulus measures may present the best chance address this continuing problem join the presidentelect and many this senate calling for stcentury technology create jobs and help our economy more robust and competitive the long term this about creating immediate jobs and can get that with technological infrastructure but also about creating jobs way that leaves with something that will actually move this economy forward this technological infrastructure whether the electricity grid whether the broadband have spoken about today really our rural electrification our interstate highway program our generations chance build this infrastructure way that will fit the changing needs this country and allow compete the world stage madam president yield the floor and suggest the absence quorum

madam president would like speakand joined the floor comember the intelligence committee senator ron wyden who will also speak this issueabout the bill that senators rockefeller wyden and whitehouse and introduced yesterday the lawful interrogation and detention act began this effort some time ago because believe very strongly time end the failed experiment guantanamo time repudiate torture and secret disappearances time end the outsourcing coercive interrogations outside contractors believe time return the norms and values that have driven the united states greatness since the days george washington but have been tarnished the past years that what both senator wyden and hope this bill will have sent copy presidentelect obamas transition team have had occasion talk with him about and indicated that look work closely with him what this bill would require the president close the detention facilities guantanamo bay within months the need close this facility clear along with the abuses abu ghraib guantanamo has been decried throughout the world has helped our enemies recruit has reduced americas credibility worldwide strained relationships with our allies and created misguided dual legal system additionally the supreme court now has ruled four times that the procedures put place guantanamo are illegal first rasul bush the court ruled the administration could not hold detainees outside law guantanamo soil second hamdi rumsfeld which the court ruled the government could not detain citizen without due process and struck down the executives process labeling detainees unlawful enemy combatants third hamdan rumsfeld which the court struck down the administrations process for trying detainees outside the civilian legal system the uniform code military justice and most recently boumediene which the court ruled that detainees must afforded habeas corpus guantanamo was explicitly created separate and lesser system justice hold people captured near the battlefield afghanistan indefinitely years has produced three convictions including australian david hickswho agreed plea bargain get off the island and osama bin ladens driver salim hamdan whose sentence almost already the hard part about closing guantanamo not deciding figuring out what with the remaining detainees under the lawful interrogation and detention act the approximately individuals now being held there would handled one five ways they can charged with crime and tried the united states the federal civilian military justice systems these systems have handled terrorists and other dangerous individuals before and are capable dealing with classified evidence and other unusual factors second individuals could transferred international tribunal such tribunal exists third detainees could returned their native countries that not possible they could transferred different country date more than men have been sent from guantanamo the custody other countries recently portugal and other nations have suggested they would open taking some the remaining detainees way help close guantanamo that good news there are detainees who cannot charged with crimes transferred the custody another country there fourth option the secretary defense and the director national intelligence agree individual poses security threat the united states the government may release him this may work for example for the chinese uighurs remaining guantanamo believe five six uighurs have already been released the district court for the district columbia has ordered that the remaining uighurs released into our country that decision has been stayed upon appeal finally for detainees who cannot addressed any one the other four options the executive branch could hold them under existing authorities provided the law armed conflict believe these options provide sufficient flexibility handle the people now being held guantanamo the incoming obama administration decides that other alternatives are needed hope they will come the congress explain the specifics the problem and will work toward joint legislative solution the three other provisions the legislation end parts the cias secret detention and interrogation program some the details the program are already publicly known such the use waterboarding three individuals some years ago other aspects remain secret such the other authorized interrogation techniques and how they are used there have been public allegations multiple deaths detainees cia custody there was one conviction cia contractor the death detainee afghanistan but other details remain classified but well known that august the justice department approved coercive interrogation techniques including waterboarding for the cias use this despite the fact that the justice department has prosecuted the use waterboarding and the state department has decried overseas the administration used what believe faulty logic and faulty reasoning say that waterboarding was not torture fact will never turn this sad page our nations history until all coercive techniques are banned and are replaced with single clear uniform standard across the government cannot say that too strongly that standard established this legislation the interrogation set protocols outlined the army field manual this the field manual not casual document has been developed and revised over period time contains specific interrogation techniques they work for the military and operate under the same framework the timehonored approach the fbi the cia would abide its terms would work for the cia well these techniques were the heart former fbi special agent jack cloonans successful interrogation those involved the world trade center bombing they were also the tools used special agent george piro get saddam hussein provide the evidence that resulted his death sentence have powerful expert testimony that the army field manual techniques work against terrorist suspects the manuals use across the government supported scores retired generals and admirals gen david petraeus and former secretaries state and national security advisers both parties majoritiesin both houses congress passed this provision last year part the fiscal year intelligence authorization bill offered that amendment believe senator wyden will remember the joint conference between the house and the senate intelligence committees and was added the bill sends clear message that not support coercive interrogations but regrettably the presidents veto the bill stopped from becoming law the presidentelect agrees that need end coercive interrogations and comply strictly the terms the convention against torture and the geneva conventions look forward working with him end this sad story our nations history the third part this legislation ban contractor interrogators the cia now this interesting unlike the fbi where fbi agents their own interrogations cia agents not carry out all their interrogations they hire contractors general hayden has testified the cia hires and keeps contract people who are not intelligence professionals and whose sole job break detainees and get them talk now firmly and staunchly believe that outsourcing interrogations whether coercive more appropriate ones private companies way diminish accountability also believe the use contractors leads more brutal interrogations than they were done government employees think about you can have set interrogation practices and dependent upon who administers them and the length time they are administered and the combination which they are administered they can have very different effects individual there are surely areas where paid contractors make practical and financial sense interrogation form collecting intelligence not one them the fourth and the final provision this legislation requires that the cia and other intelligenqe agencies provide notification the international committee the red cross the icrc their detainees following notification the cia will required provide international red cross officials with access detainees the same way the military does access the icrc hallmark international law and required the geneva conventions access third party and the icrc particular was seen the united states guarantee that american men and women would protected they were ever captured overseas believe still remains that guarantee remain nation war and credible actionable intelligence remains cornerstone our war effort but this war that will won fighting smarter not sinking the depths our enemies our nation has paid enormous price because these interrogations they cast shadow and doubt over our ideals and our system justice our enemies have used our practices recruit more extremists our key global partnerships crucial winning the war terror have been strained will take time resume our place the worlds beacon liberty and justice but deeply believe and the cosponsors believe this bill will put that path and start the process urge its passage ask unanimous consent have printed the record the history this legislation and the matters contains
now will defer distinguished friend colleague the senator from oregon the honorable ron wyden
madam president very pleased able out the senate floor today with our incoming chair the intelligence committee todiscuss this legislation senator feinstein and have sat next each other the intelligence committee now for think about years have talked about this issue many occasions commend the senator from california for all her leadership this the right way start off our committee breaking with the last years flawed policies that have been dubious effectiveness and dubious legality very pleased honored one our cosponsors and note that our outgoing chair senator rockefeller one our cosponsors and sheldon whitehouse the distinguished senator from rhode island one the cosponsors and great addition our committee well thank the chair for all her leadership what think senator feinstein has touched upon and very thoughtfully you share our view that possible fight terrorism ferociously without compromising american laws american values you must senator feinstein has correctly stated you must smarter order strike that balance dangerous world regrettably this administration has not been willing show this sort wisdom all too often for the last years the administration has engaged complicated legal gymnastics justify antiterrorism programs that view are questionable effectiveness questionable legality today the incoming chair our committee senator feinstein helping with this important legislation the lawful interrogation and detention act helping right the balance and show the country that with smart antiterrorism policies can effectively fight the war against terrorism and the same time restore our moral authority and protect our values will tell you based the information have seen again and again and what are told military leaders these coercive techniques simply are not effective general petraeus for example has discussed with respect soldiers iraq that coercive techniques may usable terms forcing someone talk but that does not necessarily mean the person will say something that protects american security senator mccain our distinguished colleague from arizona has made much the same point certainly the use these techniques number instances can detrimental our national security certainly the techniques have discouraged allies the past from cooperating with and frankly view they serve something recruiting poster for our enemies one the areas hope pursue the future not part this legislation but working with our incoming chair working with our ranking minority member senator bond and the administration the presidentelect hope able declassify significant portion the history this program particularly the legal underpinnings this program the american people will actually able see that much what has been done the last years simply not effective the war against terrorism the american people deserve certainly important recognize that when americans are captured abroad the future international standards prisoner treatment particularly the geneva convention will sometimes the only shield they have these standards have evolved from hopeful ideals into widely observed rules conduct partly because the most powerful country earth has led example anytime our government attempts dodge these standards weakens them and increases the risk abuse for our prisoners the fact that our worst enemies have horrifying and barbaric methods for dealing with prisoners does not view make these methods useful legitimate confident that presidentelect obama not going engage many the practices that have seen the last years but certainly want pass legislation that codifies these important principles and makes sure that none his future successors engage these practices that means you have make the laws plain you have make them strong this legislation will make them plainer and stronger than they are today would submit that essentially what senator feinstein has been working for all these past years want mention couple the other provisions was struck senator feinsteins comment with respect the use contractor interrogators the cia senator feinstein noted not get have lot open sessions our intelligence committee that for obvious reasons are dealing with classified material but have felt senator feinstein very strongly about this topic and actually raised this concern with admiral mcconnell his confirmation hearing head our intelligence service remain concerned about this issue and that provision the feinstein legislation especially important view because interrogators must accountable under the clear language with respect these interrogators the feinstein legislation that will the case finally let comment the provision that closes the prison guantanamo during the past years was concerned about the potential impact this legislation and this provision was concerned that point because was not clear that president bush had competent plan for dealing with all the prisoners currently held there was concerned that closing guantanamo could simply lead massive upswing extraordinary rendition fortunately presidentelect obama working different strategy for dealing with those prisoners guantanamo longer have the same concern that under his administration would simply have prisoners handed over foreign countries that would torture them have long believed that you looked the intent the bush administration this area they sought create prison guantanamo bay that would under control but beyond the reach law now the supreme court has definitively ruled that constitutional protections apply people guantanamo bay would hope that even the prisons strongest advocates would say serves useful purpose the combination the clear language the feinstein legislation discuss today and that presidentelect obama looking comprehensive plan for dealing with the prisoners guantanamo leaves with reassurance that there chance close this prison and responsible fashion that will protect americas national security interests there are four who are sponsoring this legislation have sought for many months get these issues interrogation and guantanamo right have consistently tried pursue this bipartisan fashion are going continue this session believe under the leadership our incoming chair going possible get our nations counterterrorism program back firm legal and operational footing and prevent the mistakes the past from being repeated yield the floor
madam president thank the senator are both westerners did sit together for about years the committee such have had chance discuss great deal about this topic matter very deep conscience and sense values everything this nation stands for the thing that sets apart from many other countries who pick people and horrible things them dont that have always had such pride that the senator hit nail the head people may talk but they can say anything they want not necessarily valuable not necessarily actionable intelligence sometimes might but there are other ways doing this and not sacrificing the values hold dear the nearest tool achieve that the army field manual has been great for work with the senatbr from oregon and look forward working with him the future thank him very much yield the floor and suggest the absence quorum
madam president ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call rescinded
madam president ask unanimous consent that allowed speak for such time may consume morning business
thank you madam president come the floor today offer support for the lawful interrogation and detention act which very distinguished colleagues senator feinstein california and senator wyden oregon have just spoken about this bill would three very important things the first force the closing the interrogation and detention activities the guantanamo base have supported previous legislation that would this enthusiastically support this legislation the bush administration has created pretty significant mess with the activities down guantanamo unfortunately some things you can snarl tightly that becomes very difficult unsnarl them and afraid that exactly the situation with guantanamo will difficult unsnarl real challenge for the incoming administration but vital that because has become symbol the rest the world americas departure from our core principles enthusiastically support that provision another provision would restrict our interrogation activities those techniques that are permitted under the army field manual effect would end our embrace enhanced interrogation techniquesindeed torture support this notion would cite gen david petraeus the commander the multinational force iraq who the time wrote letter all military forces iraq that letter said this some may argue that would more effective sanctioned torture other expedient methods obtain information from the enemy they would wrong beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary certainly extreme physical action can make someone talk however what the individual says may questionable value fact our experience applying the interrogation standards laid out the army field manual shows that the techniques the manual work effectively and humanely eliciting information from detainees have heard arguments that well you cant really rely military interrogators they dont really know what they are doing they are amateurish they need the limitations the army field manual contrast the interrogators the cia and our intelligence community are experts and much more sophisticated and adept and dont need have the army field manual restricting them some sort learners permit for interrogation you look the facts the reverse actually true the military that has officers with literally decades experience interrogating enemy prisoners interrogating enemy prisoners situations where their fellow soldiers lives are the line where men and women will die live because the information they are able elicit notwithstanding those high stakes they live the terms the army field manual contrast know that the cia really did not know much about interrogations that when they got into the business they had learn about the place they chose learn was from the sere program program designed train american soldiers airmen sailors and marines who are likely captured enemies that engage torture how prepared for that how withstand for training purposes prepare them for these ordeals they used the interrogation techniques despot tyrant nationsnorth korea communist china soviet russia for some reason that was where our intelligence community thought needed for expertise how you interrogate prisoners never minding the fact that the purpose those despot regimes was not interrogate prisoners and get actionable intelligence information was torture those prisoners they would say things and produce propaganda for those tyrant reginfes the notion that the military bunch amateurs intelligence who need the constraint the army field manual prevent them from making amateur errors and the cia bunch clever crafty experts who can operate graduate level for all this absolutely backward the damage that has been done our country this decision opinion incalculable when think the choice that was made this road reminded phrase winston churchills describes bad and dangerous decision that leads worsening consequences this way describes going down the stairway which leads dark gulf fine broad stairway the beginning but after bit the carpet ends little farther there are only flagstones and little farther still these break beneath your feet that where stand now this dark descending stairway with flagstones crumbling beneath our feet and the world looking horror our departure from our core principles believe this legislation will help turn back away from that dark and descending stairway back into the light our own best principles and the good will our fellow nations america has not only suffered grievous and lasting harm from this administrations embrace torture but also from this administrations embrace tortures handmaiden tortures handmaiden course secret detention the bill senator feinstein and senator wyden are proposing would require the international committee for the red cross have access any prisoners held the intelligence agencies the icrc has been visiting detainees connection with armed conflict since nearly century the icrc visited over half million detainees different countries ensure respect for their life dignity and fundamental right judicial guarantees all those notions are enshrined our own constitution they are our national bedrock thirtyeight retired military leaders distinguished generals and admirals have concluded that the icrc access prisoners held our government critical measure ensure continuing respect for the norm that icrc access must provided all captives wartime this letter comes from battlefield warriors and intelligence officers who participated every major american conflict from world war until today one them less than years ago was member our joint chiefs staff they understand that this important and they understand why down the corridors history and survey the evil practices tyrant regimes find one their most notorious methods coercion and subjugation holding prisoners secretly and incommunicado from the oubliettes the bourbon kings france calcuttas black hole from the gestapos secret prisons the soviet gulags from medieval dungeons the bamboo cages the cambodian killing fields secret and anonymous imprisonment has always been the hallmark the despot and now the bush administration has stamped america with this shameful mark our military leaders who are the best position judge are pushing back and saying enough why they that think they that because they are not beguiled the force arms they live with the likelihood armed conflict injuries fatalities they understand that engage that defend principles and give away those principles without shot fired accomplishes the very harm that have military that have intelligence services protect from what ask ourselves that makes our country great whence cometh our strength for centuries america has been called shining city hill are lamp the darkness other nations one our greatest senators our friend ted kennedy the occasion believe his vote this institution said america not land promise torture anonymous detention and secret cells break that promise extinguish that lamp and darken that city hill our strength americans comes from the fact that stand for something our strength comes from the aspirations millions people around the globe who want like who want their country like ours who want believe what believe our strength comes when embody the hopes and dreams mankind our strength comes president clinton said not from the example our power but from the power our example believe senator feixsteins legislation will restore across this darkening world the power americas example turn back from that dark and descending stairway and restore the place where america belongs ideal and example for other nations appreciate senator felnstei hard work putting this legislation together appreciate the support senator wyden many months ago offered the first amendment the intelligence committee that would apply the army field manual interrogation techniques used our intelligence agencies and senator feinstein was kind enough cosponsor that amendment worked together conference get that amendment passed into legislation that was subsequently vetoed submitted the international committee the red cross access provision last year cannot find words strong enough explain the strength view about the things sacrifice for whatever small shortterm tactical intelligence advantage may achieve from torture and secret cells assuming there even are any most intelligence professionals believe that what you get from torture people who will say anything get away from the pain but lets assume there some value for the sake argument cannot find words strong enough explain how overwhelmed that small tactical value the loss our reputation and our standing and the confidence and trust our friends and allies when engage behaviors that have been associated with despots and tyrants and the worst historys regimes lets put this behind lets support this bill through this time transition american government lets also through time transitiod americas reputation the world yield the floor suggest the absence quorum

madam president want join colleagues today honoring the extraordinary service and accomplishments the senior senator from west virginia the honorable robert byrd was exactly years ago today january that was first sworn into the senate senator byrd the longest serving senator history and truly living legend this institution that loves dearly and defends fiercely the almanac american politics says robert byrd may come closer the kind senator the founding fathers had mind than any other couldnt agree more person wise and mature jjidgment patriot with deep love his country passionately loyal the constitution and fierce defender the role and prerogatives congress and the senate particular senator byrd was once asked how many presidents had served under answered that had not served under any president that had served with presidents proud member separate and coequal branch government during his five decades this body senator byrd has witnessed many changes our country has gone through think about our population since has grown million people there have been new technologies was thinking about this graduated from high school des moines the year before the russians had launched sputnik and were trying catch had not established ourselves space was out high school that summer getting ready college found job working this new construction project called the interstate highway system which was just beginning that time jet air travel was just starting remember first flight the airplane was propeller driven didnt have jet aircraft there were some the military but hadnt started for commercial air travel that time had computers cell phones and nine out ten sets were black and white that was the year robert byrd came the senate there have been many changes that have happened over the last years across this half century rapid change there has been one constantsenator byrds tireless service this country his passion for helping bring new opportunities the people west virginia and his dedication this institution the senate the united states senator byrd person many accomplishments and rich legacy but above all will mention his commitment improving public education and expanding access higher education especially for kids from poorer families many colleagues know robert byrd was raised the hardscrabble coalfields southern west virginia that one thing and have always talked about father was coal miner also the state iowa his family was poor but rich values and faith his parents nurtured robert byrd lifelong passion for education and learning was valedictorian his high school class but too poor college right away those were the days before pell grants and byrd scholarships worked welder shipyard later butcher coal company town took him years save enough money start college was senator when earned his law degree other member congress before since has started and completed law school while serving the congress but degrees dont begin tell

listened either here the floor later when got television closed circuit our offices the many speeches robert byrd gave about the roman senate wonderful descriptions the roman senate and how operated could hear how weaved the operations our own senate there are some who think robert byrd actually served the roman senate but that part the byrd legend can absolutely say not true have talked length about senator byrds education because explains why passionate about ensuring that every american has access quality public education both and higher the one thing senator byrd and have common our fathers were coal miners with very little formal education coming from poor background senator byrd believes that cardinal responsibility government provide ladder opportunity that everyone matter how humble their background has shot the american dream said ladder opportunity didnt say escalator escalator you get free ride you get and you get free ride but with ladder opportunity you still have exert energy and effort and responsibility get the top but with that ladder there have rungs you can actually climb the most important rungs that ladder opportunity involve education early childhood education head start programs quality public schools access college and other forms higher education during years the senate one has fought harder for public education than senator robert byrd chairman the appropriations committee has been the champion education every turn fighting reduce class size improving teacher training bringing new technologies into the classroom boosting access higher education first year the senate created the only national merit based college scholarship program funded through the department education congress later named them his honor originally the byrd scholarships consisted year award outstanding students today byrd scholarships provide grants over years how many kids meager means coming from lowincome families but very bright very capable have received these byrd scholarships which got them through college senator byrd has also been outspoken challenging the current administration for failing keep its commitments under the child left behind act the last fiscal year child left behind has been underfunded since when first came into existence has been underfunded over billion think what that would mean for our local school systems america had kept our commitment funding child left behind but will tell you this would have been lot worse senator byrd had not been here our appropriations committee either chairman ranking member sponsoring the key amendments boost the funding above what the bush administration had proposed senator byrd great student literature and sure knows the canterbury tales probably lot heart knows lot things heart memory describing the clerk oxford chaucer might just well have been describing robert byrd here what chaucer said about the clerk oxford filled with moral virtue was his speech and gladly would learn

repeatedly that this terrible depression worst economy since the thirties was around the late was around and and gathered some numbers about those days had oil crisis and energy crisis and had lets see unemployment january and rose lets see mild recession from january july but unemployment got and eventually got over percent and recall thinking when this guy reagan started talking aboutand was the army the time fort benning georgiaand heard him and was just such gifted communicator and communicated confidence and good feeling about this country and helped make america stronger when america felt stronger there much the mental status the people this country but inflation had reached percent soared percent and here had guy reagan who was saying that president could bring down doubledigit inflation could bring down doubledigit unemployment could bring down doubledigit interest rates recall wife and bought our first house out near fort benning georgia and dad was concerned with the high interest rate being over percent and said you know son just doesnt get any higher than that why dont you wait until comes down and yet the time were selling our house after years fort benning there were people wanting desperately absorb percent loans because the interest rates had gotten high fact ive got some data gathered that the federal funds rate was about percent rose percent june the prime interest rate eventually reached percent june and here was this candidate named reagan saying can help bring these things down and remember telling wife the time like this guy member the army could not criticize coinmander chief because was the chain command and thats courtmartialable offense you couldnt say anything critical about the commander chief but was excited about this guy reagan but said wife lets face there way one man even the president the united states could bring down doubledigit unemployment doubledigit inflation and doubledigit interest rates mean one man just cant that and these things started peaking through the late and and and behold was able turn things around had massive tax cut and the economy turned around and started going the other way and and behold doubledigit interest rates fell below percent unemployment rates fell below percent interest rates inflation all those things came down and was wrong apparently one man could make that much difference now some the folks know here madam speaker like president george bush think good man honorable man despite what some folks say like him hes smarter than people give him credit but jeff foxworthy says often when people who are not from the south hear southern accent they immediately deduct points from what they think the the speaker but when our secretary the treasury convinced him say the treasury secretary said that were about have this terrible depression and could have stock crash like some the private meetings could that once the first bank fails theyll all fail well have worse depression than the well have all these terrible things those kinds things when said from the highest people the country can become selffulfilling prophesies you need have presidents that will come forward and aay the only real thing have fear fear itself roosevelt did you need spread calm and confidence and there are obviously many issues which disagree with presidentelect obama but one the things see about this man prepares take over the presidency has real gift for spreading confidence spreading calm and spreading hope likes say now weve been hearing lot lately people trying set the bar low that anything does will pass the bar but the fact need all our national leaders spreading confidence you dont that saying were this terrible depression because are not when you actually look the numbers are much better shape nation than were dont have hostages being held iran and looking just helpless the rest the country president bush has certainly made clear and think some presidentelect obamas appointments has made clear the rest the world you dont attack will respond and hope that will continue its important message but should not claim that things are worse than they are because that becomes selffulfilling though have say scaring congress enough there were about republicans and about three times that many democrats who voted for the bailout bill mainly because the secretary the treasury scared them enough into doing thats not basis for making good judgments help direct this ship state now theres another billion the original billion tarp funds that were that bailout bill all that requiredand know there are some who say congress will get have upordown vote the bill doesnt say that the bill says all the treasury secretary has filea plan mean goodness his plan could just say want spend billion and send all friends and under the law there vote disapproving within days can take the money and spend have already seen billion squandered now know that secretary paulson had his department issue report last week that says have studied what did and think didno they dont say think they said did great thing saved the economy well one the things they were doing was spending hundreds billions dollars were told get more credit loosen the credit have been sent copies letters from banks that received billions and billions dollars taxpayer money and the letters say were not going able make car loans anymore were not going floor plan dealers anymore now one the things congress has done thats been problem force lenders lend money people who could not afford pay back not favor doing that dont want force lenders into making bad loans but when billions and billions american taxpayer dollars are extended these huge banks and the same time ive seen press releases from those banks that say this will really help extend more credit lend more money this will help with the credit crunch and then follow shortly thereafter saying were not going lend like used and were holding money reserve had absolutely the opposite effect what was supposed have that causes great concern has not opened lending and the fact this congress could allocate trillion detroit auto makers but people cannot buy cars from the dealers and the dealers have all the banks pulling back floor plans saying were not going help you get cars sell other buyers then will wasted money youve got have people able buy cars any money given detroit absolutely wasted there was some criticism secretary paulson and was one those who was appropriately critical for not having more restrictions the money that was given away some went bonuses instead extending more credit some banks actually bought competition which means there will less credit extended because there are fewer lenders out there extend that money thd way credit had the exact opposite effect was supposed and with all due deference the secretary the treasury patting himself and his department the back for doing such great and noble job just dont see what weve had happen here ive been joined one colleagues from georgia man have the utmost respect for someone whom have the greatest confidence and admiration and know that when have idea better off running him before float out publicly and would like yield friend lynn westmoreland from georgia
thank the gentleman from texas might not your accent that hurts you with the points but may have been your introduction but good here with you talk about the stimulus package voted against the stimulus package the recovery bill know you did and many others did because didnt see any real plan out there and the only plan that really heard madam speaker you will remember they said there was bad automobile wreck that this credit crisis was like bad automobile wreck clogging the expressway and that behind this accident there were trucks carrying student loans automobile loans mortgage loans all different types credit and that because this accident that those loans were not getting through the people that needed them need spend billion and think the time they said was about percent bad mortgage home loans and there are about million mortgages thats roughly million loans this credit crunch was caused these million loans spend billion cleared the accident least were told that were clearing the accident but the accident not cleared cleared nobody has let the traffic through because there are people every day being foreclosed because the banks that are getting this money and one bank particular that does business georgia got billion tarp money and they are foreclosing people every day they are not giving people opportunity restructure their loans they are calling more principal due these loans and not telling bank make bad loans but the reason that are this situation because they originally made bad loans what think were telling them they need clean the bad loans that they madc they need clean their own mess but now that theyve got taxpayers dollars they especially need using that for the iitent that congress gave them there was article and think was the new york times this the name the article december fed cuts key rate record low says much greater practical importance the fed bluntly announced that would print much money necessary revive the frozen credit markets and fight what shaping the nations worst economic downturn since world war and you addressed that were not necessarily that economic downturn and were going continue print money until unfreeze the credit market well this first billion should have done something help fall out the least but people every dayi have got builders and developers small business people district the third district georgia every week calling saying were going out business good friend mine has been the grading business his family has been the grading business for years hes been running for the past years his father started called and said lynn today the last day were going business ive got employees that have been with for over years that have got let what need tell them about the bailout this money not getting through these small businesspeople and need make these lending institutions accountable talked chairman frank and said that theyre going come with bill about the next weeks make these people accountable and they need held accountable these are taxpayers dollars these are peoples individual dollars going this bailout and they are not having the ability even access any the money these banks are holding the money and theyre holding the money they can buy small banks ive had community bankers call and say applied for tarp but cant get cant get the tarp money you think that some the big nine are going into our communities into grantville georgia griffin georgia thomaston greenville georgia and make somebody loan that wants open barber shop wants have nail salon wants automotive repair shop depend these community bankers and right now these big banks are sitting around waiting these community banks fail they can gobble them and away with our community banks these community banks some them told they voted not get them the gentleman from texas they voted not take the tarp money the federal regulators came and said you need take the tarp money and then they applied for and couldnt get have got stop this nonsense and need let the free market work will ork has worked will work again will just quit muddying the water now hear about this new stimulus package that the presidentelect going come with going create about million jobs and heard today the news before came over here trillion which means that each one these jobs going about now dont know about you but thats pretty expensive for the taxpayers create million jobs apiece would think that might create with that kind money might create lot more jobs than that apiece twice asmany jobs fact know lot people today that would just love have job but the government creating jobs new government jobs thats percent the people exclusive the postal service that employ right now are fixing employ percent more people now thats great that are creating these jobs but that means that this people are going have continue paid every year and their insurance and their benefits telling you are going down real rocky road glad that the presidentelect has realized that this economic situation that are facing our country today needs some attention this congress has tried give the attention the current president has tried give the attention but think there has been too much love and not enough firm discipline that everyday citizen out there facing the firm discipline not being able pay your bills they dont have the ability print more money and they are out there suffering are not doing the suffering here keep printing the money and keep throwing out there and keeps going the big dogs keeps going the people that made these major mistakes that leveraged some these mortgage investments and are bailing them out and the average guy not getting bailed out have got real good friend mine that called yesterday his early has been the real estate business and the building business along with mehe and have been together for long timehe going the police academy starting the police academy starting new career because cannot make living doing what hes doing need wake and realize that are going clear the wreck are going unfreeze this credit market these lending institutions need accountable the taxpayers and make sure that they are taking this money and doing what they are supposed with and not just paying their top dogs their bigwigs all this money going the resorts sponsoring championship football games buying banks china for billion but they are lending the money out dont care you have got credit rating you are not going able borrow dime because they are afraid they dont want lend and they are saving this money help their balance sheets this way run railroad its not the intention that this congress had need something make these people that are receiving this tarp money accountable need make them back and correct the bad loans that they made and make sure that the everyday guy out there thats furnishing this billion can have some type benefit from with that appreciate you giving the opportunity this
thank you westmoreland for participating you have made some great points you know have talked number builders there east texas where represent back september know things were tough lot places the country back september but the contractors were telling they are doing okay you know its just not fantastic but they are doing okay soon started hearing all the gloom and doom started hear people say you know were going buy house were going build house were going buy car but since are told may headed for depression are going hold and wait and see you know maybe sometime next year dont want buying new house building new house building new building for our business are about hit depression what happens people quit buying cars they quit building contractors say you know always love when the phone rings that means may somebody thats about build another building but lately they cringe every time the phone rings because means someone else may calling say had talked you were planning building something the first the year but lets hold and wait and see this depression really coming let tell you little more about the when people say this the worst since the actually there were approximately state and federally chartered savings and loans institutions with total assets over billion lets see between and with billion assets failed things were going badly this country banks failing crisis all kinds things that had been built ready start happening during the and the early that began happening were not for the foresight have tax cuts stimulate the economy then things never would have turned around but ronald reagan did good job doing that now friend westmoreland read the quote the fed printing money they are printing money like crazy there are consequences doing that for those that really believe many solutions can found history because you can back historically solomon said there nothing new under the sun there new technology but there are not new issues these things have all been tried and failed succeeded you back and you say okay this what was done this year that failed this was done here that succeeded lets over the things that succeeded and have seen over and over that you want create inflation saw the late and the very early just print money like the fed doing now are very fortunate that havent hit huge inflation rate the last months and why would that well back last summer were paying gallon for gasoline and now many are paying that kind thing for gasoline are very fortunate that the price energy failed time when were printing money like crazy but cannot keep doing that print trillion over the next years will devastate this country with inflation are talking about the for those you who remember your history going back after world war germany was very very difficult circumstances their economy was real problem they had elected officials they were trying turn things around they thought they could print money and print their way out their economic troubles and some people remember the illustration people carrying wheelbarrows money the supermarketwasnt supermarkets back thenbut the market just buy essentials and food thats where this leads when you just keep unabatedly printing money like being done now the inflation will come will devastate this country silly doing that when know from history what happens you really want get scared look what happened germany the and going into the the economy got desperate because all this inflation they ended electing little guy with funny mustache that was such bigot and such meanspirited man devastated the planet israel having difficulty now having rockets fired them each day from the gaza strip from hamas during that little man with the mustaches regime over million jewish people were slaughtered why because good people germany got desperate because inflation and they elected man who was going help with their economy not realizing just how mentally unbalanced the man was and millions and millions and millions the entire world suffered result this nation has been the defender freedom around the world this nation has been the most solid economy around the world the world depends make good judgment this body and when fail its not just those this body that suffers its the nation its the vorld that suffers touching and the older get the more turn into late mother who just got tearyeyed and emotional about all kinds things was deeply touching see all the children madam speaker gathered here around the speakers rostrum yesterday were sworn cute children all races both genders just really neat great wholesome bipartisan democratic kids republican members kids but the thought that went through mind dont change our ways these are the sweet little children that adults will pay literally pay for what are doing are running debt those little kids that they should never have pay for live now that wrong need helping our children not saddling them with more debt and thats what overzealous stimulus package will thats why yesterday the first bill that was laid down the desk over here filed was month tax holiday bill filed december and filed again yesterday with this congress takes the billion still remaining the bailout bill and section its not long bill just has pages section immediate termination tarp purchase authority that important principle time end the authority that gave one person the secretary the treasury with all this unfettered ability just squander money mean the main restriction there was couldnt bail out central banks foreign governments but basically you read through the billand afraid there werent enough people that didand just goes and the secretary determines tried point out people have never since had constitution given that kind authority one man should never give that kind authority one man was mistake you dont give unrestricted authority like that just out and squander money matter which party power doesnt matter this country the principles that made great the principles that caused the signers the declaration independence pledge their lives and their fortunes and cause many them lose and give their lives their families lives their complete fortunes was the principle that government does not need have this kind unrestricted authority and yet the market dropped points and all sudden people who knew our history knew the principles which this nation was founded were all sudden ready come rushing here and give one man that kind authority george washington before the constitution december was given that kind authority didnt ask for hardly used any used his leadership persuade the soldiers reenlist thats why the bill was passed december the continental congress knew these guys dont reenlist january are all dead and will our families dead thats why they passed the bill giving washington this unfettered authority spend money used his leadership persuade them reenlist even that terrible winter thats leadership but washington said people unused restraint must led they will not driven and too often con gress try drive people instead leading people thats one part month tax holiday bill ends the authority now madam speaker people need understand that this bill the bailout bill that was passed september there was billion appropriated give another billion all has file plan and dont vote for days bill funded bringing that billion back into the treasury what did learn historically from the tax cuts that president john kennedy did president ronald reagan did and president george bush did will just overlook the last months where forgot our principles here this administration but you back those tax cuts the economy was stimulated and each time the revenue into the federal treasury did not decrease increased dramatically because the economy went strong there are two ways raise revenue this country one raising taxes and then you have immediate increase tax dollars coming into the treasury but the longterm effect repeatedly have seen kill the economy you can lower taxes and immediately stimulate the economy and then result the economy being stimulated then more tax dollars than ever come than even when you raise taxes all what you want happen longterm for the sake our children and those follow and that why this bill says instead the treasury secretary squandering doesnt use that term course but that what has happened squandering billion allows the people who earned the money keep for two months that about billion month that individuals pay into the treasury individual income tax now really need longterm tax reform need drop the capital gains rate like ireland did percent which has really helped their economy think their corporate tax rate percent businesses are flooding into ireland sick and tired too hearing people say will never get manufacturing jobs back into america that hogwash look around the world some went china what was the number one reason industry was moving china they told why they moved their industry yes they said labor cheaper but have better quality control back the our workers produce better products back the but the corporate tax rate less than half what here lower the corporate tax rate you will see manufacturing jobs flood back into the united states that what all about some them said you know they cut deal corporate tax rates china were able build brand new facility with stateoftheart equipment and basically was paid for very quickly out money didnt pay corporate taxes and now are competitive again because our aging factories the were costing and now are stateoftheart all you have lower the tax rate jobs will instantly appear after our own energy this country know the energy rates are going come and need something about now produce our own energy that are doing that and this inflation cycle doesnt kill going back month tax holiday bill says far the tax cut part the case wages received for services performed during the period beginning the first full month after the passage this bill the percentage tax will zero now heard from some selfemployed people who said well not going help being selfemployed work just hard harder than anyone else and yet not included yet that not accurate that included says clearly the case selfemployment income for service performed during the month period the percentage tax will zero there will withholding during the month period for income tax there will withholding for fica have gotten good suggestions newt gingrich has been extremely helpful suggestions and spreading the word jed babbin and neal boortz steve morton many many great thinkers have been helpful but presidentelect obama promised that you make less than you will get tax cut some have been concerned when give tax cuts people that dont pay taxes that that not tax cut that welfare under this bill the tax cuts people that pay taxes there are know people who not pay income tax they dont make enough they work hard they earn wage but not enough get the level paying income tax they still have fica withheld from their check under this bill fica will withheld from their bill and because the employee has fica taken out then the employer who struggling make sure they keep people employed gets month holiday paying fica well some have said well this will hurt people social security wont because specifically says that and this section funding social security trust funds with repealed tarp funds covered the billion doesnt get doled out for bonuses for the nations wealthy who have mismanaged their banks their firms and then reward themselves with bonuses doesnt there goes the people who have earned everyone who working will get tax break some have said well would appreciate having the withholding not taken out for months that will really help for those months but will hurt the end the year when have pay that they miss the point there federal tax for months under this bill everybody gets tax cut actually what this very short very efficient bill does exactly what presidentelect obama promised would done with the exception doesnt have cap now there are those know who are doing well and are able live off the dividend income and the interest income and that harder course after the stock market went down and god bless those folks thrilled death that you are position where you can live off dividend and interest income would like see acrosstheboard complete tax reform but under this bill this does not give tax breaks for unearned income like interest and dividend this only for wages earned during this time you are hardworking american you are going get tax cut under this bill does exactly what presidentelect obama promised for anyone who pays any fica income tax for months you get that tax break now ironic that the bailout bill was partly under the guise that are going give all these billions hundreds billions banks they can increase credit make more loans people cat refinance their loans and finance into the new refinance money what they are behind they dont lose their homes well have talked people who say they could have their withholding from their check their check for months they can catch lot people fell behind last summer when gas prices were gallon they get their withholding for couple months have seen figures that estimated your family income household income the range you could get over that month period they could catch the mortgage and you wouldnt have borrow more money catch your mortgage you could catch have had some people tell want get out from under this gasguzzling car have got but when energy prices went the value any car went far down now owe more car than worth cant trade because dont have down payment for another car would without car have keep paying this gasguzzler would like get more efficient car this would allow those people buy new car more efficient car good for everybody but come back what said earlier people cannot buy cars then doesnt matter how many trillions dollars give the auto makers they are going still ultimately out business and the trouble with bailouts once you start giving money anybody whether bank insurance company whoever once you start that process you will always able find someone more deserving bailout than those who have already gotten money and there becomes good place stop well when you love someone and you see that they are getting addicted some substance and judge saw you see them getting addicted something then time have interdiction and say love you too much allow you continue this addiction are not going let you have any more that now was upset when were talking about auto bailout because knew the auto makers had been withholding holdback money rebate money that they contractually owed dealers they were putting dealers bind just because they werent abiding their own contracts understand they have begun catch that and that appropriate but see then letters from major banks who have gotten billions tax dollars who are now saying are not going lending money for cars are not going lending money dealers anymore even though they are wonderful dealers they have good business looks like they will stay business for good are just not going lend anymore that such abuse and degrees from what was promised now some would say should not get the federal government into the business telling lenders what with their money and one those however the danger that every bank should have been told their attorneys keep mind you take federal money the federal government going have their hand your business and they are going tell you how run because they are partner with you and happen lieve are going put federal money something should have restrictions and tell people like bank that this what you can and cant secretary paulson did not that but preference dont give away any more bailout money lets let the people that earned keep and let them decide who deserves bailed out and who deserves have their products purchased that how free market works when you look back you see that open government good thing free market good thing way thinking being such student history looks like from our founding documents the most important job that have federal government provide for the common defense then beyond that this federal government should create level playing field punish cheaters make sure everybody plays fairly and then let them play that what need doing and have gone far excess that this government when heard that were going encourage car czar couldnt believe mean cant even good job designing our own card can you imagine what would with cars good grief should not that business would encourage people speaker who believe that they would better job spending their own money contact their representative contact their senator call the capitol hill operator and they can connected their representative their senators and that would long way toward getting this bill the floor and getting passed because not issue the money will spent issue will the treasury secretary squander your behalf will you able use your own money help get this economy turned around
speaker have been concerned about the financial future our untry for some time and introduced bill set national commission review our nations longterm economy including mandatory entitlement spending discretionary spending and tax policy bipartisan have well over members from both sides the aisle the bipartisan cooperwolf safe proposal was similar the commission proposal senator conrad and senator judd gregg new hampshire would bipartisan and way review entitlement spending and force the congress act the commission has over cosponsors during the last congress weve all read speaker the stark figures the financial report the federal government even more telling during the month october and november for the first months this fiscal year the federal government piled billion red ink and were pace surpass the fiscal year deficit months almost were going rival that and yesterday presidentelect obama predicted trillion deficit said for years come now does anybody really care just seems that this institution continues and what its done the past the past few days numerous sources have reported that the economic stimulus expected cost billion and some are saying trillion speaker whatever package voted congress has the obligation their children and their grandchildren and their constituents find bipartisan way address the nations looming financial crisis including mechanism deal with the underlying problem what now autopilot spending dont this this congress when were doing the stimulus think both political parties this congress the congress will down the congress that refused deal with the fundamental issues that are facing this country theres the simon and garfunkel song the boxer that says man hears what wants hear and disregards the rest this congress disregards the overwhelming debt that have faced this nation have here speaker bill issued the federal reserve zimbabwe july last year its billion billion wont even buy loaf bread this the future our country and this congress and let just say colleagues this side our party doesnt deal with this issue and they dont deal with this issue then frankly this congress will down congress history the congress thats neglected deal with these fundamental issues many say why shortterm stimulus simultaneously with this well takes two legs walk can demonstrate that are dealing with the entitlement issue now that may very well get whatever shortterm thing were gqing demonstrate that have the commitment make work isabel sawhill senior fellow the brookings institute has likened the situation our country she said termites the woodwork slowly eroding our strength nation recently read speech richard fisher president the federal reserve bank dallas its called storms the horizon its sobering account from monetary policy point view why deficits matter and frightening put the congressional record every day would hope members congress could read but what said doing deficit math sobering exercise becomes outright painful one when you apply your calculator longterm fiscal challenge posed entitlement programs then goes say that are facing catastrophic conditions our children our grandchildren our constituents are facing catastrophic condition dont act some people say need regular order frankly dont this bipartisan way republicans demo now was critic and twice voted crats similar what did the against the billion bailout bill the iraq study group frankly think this socalled tarp the supporters that congress will not have the courage the bill will have admit that has not foresight the ability vote these restored our economy the proissues deal with ponents had advertised and fact what are saying massive some the worst times for the econpackage upordown vote repub omy were the weeks following its licans democrats this bill was draft passage the heritage foundation the the other hand those who brookings institution supported were critics should admit that the bill david walker supported david has frankly cost the government far broder david brooks econo less than had anticipated when say mists all over the country and then cost dont mean just how much uses the language that the base spent but from that must subclosing commission that requires tracted the value the securities the cause you dont require this institu bonds and the stock certificates retion act will not act will find ceived the federal government all the reasons can neglect this case secretary paulson miswill require act days led this house and the other body say colleagues this testifying that would use the side were going deal with this billion buy toxic assets bad bonds stimulus wed better have our own had done that and all voting ideas and put for proposal which the bill had every reason believe will unless tied and gagged that was telling the truth had will offer motion here force carried out that policy then would vote this have bought for the money had and say for the other side ask spent whether its the billion you the same thing could has spent far the billion that come together bipartisan way feared would spend would have when leave this congress know spent that money return for assets that have truly dealt with the enti dubious value thats why theyre tlement issue and saved america for called toxic assets our children and our grandchildren and contrast having misled the house future generations and the other body secretary paulson bought preferred stock the various financial institutions doing our economic situation and was overly generous wall street foreign policy the terms but nevertheless did
will take much but bill those who are critics must not all this hour speak roughly both recognize that what the treasury the first half the presentation will has done far far different from our economic situation the sec what all believed would fact ond half will focus foreign policy the policy know that have number col now see that billion has been leagues that may have important expended the treasury and another things say this house and they billion remains unspent come the floor ill happy yield pleased that the secretary the them few minutes time that treasury has not yet taken the proceconvenient for them dural actions release and give himeven with this long speech will not self control the remaining bilbe able cover all the details that lion like provide colleagues understanding that leadertherefore invite all colleagues ship will bring this house bill that visit the relevant portion web will release the billion the page bradsherman house gov for more treasury and will impose additional the details the matters ill dis conditions and like take few cussing here minutes address what think ought talking about our economy will that bill divide speech first talking about first the issue whether any matters relevant the financial serv the funds released any that ices committee which ive served second billion will available for years and particularly the bill the bush administration last month known tarp eesa the emer wrote the chairman the financial gency economic stabilization act best services committee saying that known the public the billion should have limits the amount that bailout bill could spent the bush administrathe second part economic pres tion out the second billion entation will deal with the stimulus fact proposed that only billion package now being put together par less available the bush administicularly the committees appro tration deal with whatever exigenpriations and ways and means cies dealt with its waning days understanding that the bill that will brought before this house will provide the bush administration with deal with whatever comes its last week office any case think having seen paulson action the vast majority this house would believe that somewhere between percent and percent the second billion made available anyone the executive branch should made available only the obama administration should point out something about process would best any bill dealing with the second billion was actually dealt with regular order now not saying necessarily that every committee possible jurisdiction should full markup but deal with this economic crisis least the primary committee each bill should have markup that members can heard and the house can work its will addition would hope that the rules committee would allow reasonable number amendments considered the floor addition would hope that the financial services committee would give the same scrutiny the financial institutions who have received and are likely receive additional bailout monies gave the executives the three automobile makers need extensive hearings need bring the titans wall street down and need have these hearings both the full committee and the subcommittee level not want give further credence the accusation that congress and the administration have two standards for scrutinizing bailout requests one for those who shower before work and more severe standard for those who must shower after work should have least the same amount scrutiny industry that has already received the bulk billion provided automobile industry that requesting amounts less than percent that amount now what should provide the way restrictions tothose who obtain bailout funds retain the bailout funds they have already received federal dollars should expended bail out private interests only the toughest terms taxpayers should demand the highest yield the largest equity upside the strictest limits executive compensation and perks even when bail out individual homeowners rather than big time executives and shareholders major companies the treasury should get large share the profit that they earn when they sell their homes why important that are tough those who seek bailout funds there are three important reasons first being tough will increase support for the program the public currently focused executive compensation and perks think will soon focus the value the securities the treasury receiving including warrants that represent the upside the potential profits company that receiving bailed out funds need public support for the enactment and there considerable public skepticism talking colleagues find very few who are enthusiastic about releasing the second billion the executive branch and find while most colleagues believe that need stimulus package there real reluctance adopt one large that being recommended many prominent economists can achieve that support this house and the public being tough those who receive bailout funds second being tough those obtaining bailout funds will help limit the number people seeking bailed out not even the federal government can afford fund all the bailouts that will demanded executives see the federal government source easy and cheap money third getting good deal tough negotiations with anyone receiving bailout will reduce the amount which are increasing the federal deficit will expending hundreds billions dollars now just addressing the billion piece that half completed there will other expenditures need reassure our children and need reassure the international markets that are acting responsibly minimize the increase the federal deficit now some the expenditures being made out the tarp funds are going money lost forever its going buying assets that turn out worthless investing companies that bankrupt that why need very large upside those our investments that are successful typically the federal government obtains upside obtaining warrants from the companies provides bailout funds these allow the taxpayers reap the benefits companys success when returns profitability and when that profitability reflected its stock price believe that the negotiations with wall street secretary paulson has been far too generous his friends the financial services industry given thle tremendous risks the federal government assuming taxpayers should receiving far more the upside return for their investments for example the recent bailout goldman sachs the taxpayer received half the rate return and onesixth the warrants that investor warren buffett was able receive similar investment that made goldman sachs for his fund the emergency economic stabilization act gives the treasury too much discretion what demand the way warrants while the treasury required obtain warrants when injects capital into financial institutions can accept few warrants likes the treasury has adopted onesizefitsall approach which provides the federal government with warrants equal percent its investment when buys preferred stock financial institution not even this percent required the statute and this percent often way too low because those healthiest banks wall street were willing give percent clearly the riskier banks wall street that got bailout funds were not adequatelyf compensating the american taxpayer for the risk are taking because they only provided percent warrants figure that might appropriate for those financial institutions that are low risk the question what can statute clearly hope that the next secretary the treasury will drive tough bargain whenever investing our taxpayer dollars private firms but can something the statute minimum should include language that was early version the house bill dealing with the automobile relief that requires warrants least percent and should make clear that this percent floor not ceiling slould direct the secretary the treasury demand warrants that fully compensate the taxpayer for the risks being taken any particular deal then turn the issue executive compensation and perks these are very important taxpayers and are important deterring those companies that dont need bailout from coming washington their private jets hats hand now the bill interpreted the bush administration has allowed multimillion dollar salaries continue paid the very executives who drove their companies into the ditch and thd bush administration has chosen impose limits perks particular the bush administration has ignored section the eesa also known the tarp bill that section states where the secretary determines that the purposes the act are best met through direct purchases troubled assets the secretary shall require that the financial institution meet appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance virtually all the billion that the secretary the treasury has expended has been pursuant his determination that could best served through direct purchases troubled assets has not done auction which was the main part the bill was trying sell instead has simply made direct purchases assets from companies negotiated one time those circumstances the law requires that shall require that the financial institution meet appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance what has secretary paulson done has allowed multimillion dollar bonuses paid the executives aig has allowed milliondollaramonth salaries continue paid executives bailedout wall street firms has allowed all those entities continue operate fleets private jets despite getting our money goldman sachs spent almost quarter million dollars year provide limo for one executive this does not constitute appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance nor should congress simply punt the executive branch what those appropriate standards should instead should provide law that company gets federal bailout the firm must limit its total compensation package any executive more than million per year for long the firm holding our money the limits should apply the whole package compensationsalaries bonuses pension plan contributions and stock options particular huge grantr stock options executive this time could bonanzaand unjustified onebecause right now all the stock prices wall street firms are depressed levels and option given executive buy shares stock for share could turn out more valuable than ton winning lottery tickets the extent any existing contract provides for executive compensation excess that which allowed under statute suggest that the bill provide that that contract void against public policy now let turn perks should limit luxury perks like corporate jets and chauffeured limousines should prevent these while any firm holding taxpayers money ill point out there are firms wall street that got money from paulson that said hey signed for the money never knew you were going get tough with fine you dont like the new rules give back our money but you retain taxpayer money then you should not goldman sachs has done paying quarter million dollars year for chauffeured limousine service for one executive the firms executives dont want take off their belts and their shoes and through airport security like the public does then that firm should not receive and should not retain bailout and probably doesnt need one for long those bailout funds are outstanding should prohibit firms from owning leasing chartering luxury jets from maintaining fleet chauffeured limousines should provide exceptions for chartering planes travel remote areas areas remote from scheduled air service and should allow some sort driver and auto provided those executives who face severe physical challenges may also want provide limits how much the company reimburses its executives per night for any hotel rooma maximum amount comes mindor per meal for any meal perhaps should per meal hate get down this level specificity but wall street has proven that they will squander the money taxpayers provide their firms lavish parties and fancy travel are not specific possible that the auto bailout bill that passed this house will used model for limiting executive compensation and perks thats the case had better strengthen first had better make clear that the limits bonuses apply not just cash bonuses but also grants stock options should limit the total compensation million year and should limit the use not just leased purchased luxury aircraft but also chartered luxury aircraft finally should have appropriate limits limousines let point out that some colleagues have noticed that was tough the auto executives who used their private jets come the first time one those companies has told very explicitly sherman the law may say that cant own the jets the law may say cant lease the jets but the law passed the house says can still charter the jets and our ceo never going fly commercial thats fine unless that firm receives bailout money once does have limit cant play shell game with the american people well limit the luxury travel and then just have the company charter the jet instead lease the jet that would fraud the american people there one other important improvement that need make the tarp bill you see after that bill passed the treasury adopted mentioned before plan buy preferred stock particular financial institutions the next administration will probably use good chunk the money back the original plan which was buy bad bondstoxic assetsfrom the financial institutions then have worried were buying bad bonds least should buy bad bonds owned american investors not the purpose this bill bail out banks london and riyadh and shanghai want make technical distinction have objection our treating american companies such firms hancock insurance and firemans fund that happen owned foreign parent should look what company american soil and should provide appropriate bailouts the companies american soil but what should not start bailing out banks shanghai london and riyadh under the bill passed from this house the bank china can sell portiolio toxic assets any headquartered entity whether owns that entity not could small branch that owns state california could some big bank wall street that does not own but the bank china can sell portfolio bad bonds headquartered entity monday and under the bill passed that entity can sell those same bonds the treasury tuesday call this the china twostep mechanism which will end bailing out the bad business investments not based companies but bad bonds which are held safes shanghai and london our new legislation should provide that the treasury can only buy assets bad bonds mortgagesproven held entitywhether its foreignowned entity not ontheground intheunited states entityon september should only buying the bad bonds that were safes located america september which the day that paulson went public with the need for bailout bill now look forward not only reforming the tarp bill but also using that reform opportunity pass other legislation within the jurisdiction the financial services committee that can help deal with this economic crisis and want point out first things that can that wont cost the treasury penny because before start spending trillions dollars should say what can get out this mess that doesnt cost anything there are couple opportunities first can increase the amount business lending that can made credit unions right now limit credit unions severely how much business lending they can could for the duration this crisis allow those credit unions make those business loans small business loans loans only talking here about smaller loans small businesses that need them need allow businesses all our districts get that loan that they need expand even stay business and just folly for take one the healthy groups financial institutions this country namely the credit unions and tell them they cant make the loan that desperately needed the small businesses our respective districts second need increase the conforming loan limit the conforming loan limit the size the loan that can purchased fannie mae and freddie mac those are basically the only loans that are being made today and the cost housing differs tremendously from one region the country another even these tough times when course most regions prices have gone down last year raised the conforming loan limit for high cost areas but allowed that increase expire effective the first day this year need restore that perhaps raise now this will not cause the federal government lose penny because fannie and freddie actually make profit the larger loans they suffer losses have suffered losses the smaller loans one way can help replenish the money that fannie and freddie have lost allow them high cost areas loans the level that can critical for some our big cities where declines house prices have badly affected local economies now let turn attention the stimulus bill the bill that will basically crafted the appropriations and ways and means committees first want approach the general principles that should covered under that bill and then want comment specific ideas that are being put forward light those principles speaker this country faces the specter depression deflationary cycle threatens long period economic contraction need enormous immediate economic stimulus but unless that stimulus well designed may not pass congress unless well designed may not achieve its objectives and unless well designed may sow the seeds future disastrous decline the value the dollar have make sure that the stimulus bill big and fast but also tough temporary and selfreversing what mean tough have said federal dollars should extended private interests only the toughest terms and have indicated there are three reasons for that first weve got discourage everyone from seeking bailout from believing that theyre suckers for not seeking bailout second need increase public support for what will highly contentious and difficulttopass stimulus bill will much easier for members vote for such bill provides the toughest terms those who are receiving extraordinary federal largess and finally pointed out getting warrants getting other securities that give share the upside will position decrease the increase the deficit occasioned the stimulus package now lets talk about why the bill must contain provisions that the stimulus temporary and reversible selfreversing fact keynesian economics offers simple prescription for the difficult times were facing now that say easy money now and fiscal and monetary austerity after the economy improves how good conscience can vote for massive economic stimulus now believe that unlikely that congress will adopt austerity later congress love handing out money know that love tax cuts and tax rebates and tax holidays and tax fiestas and benefit expansions and subsidies and bailouts and infrfastructure january projects and aid states and aid cities and rite aid koolaid like spending money can count future congresses discontinue and then reverse the fiscal expansion that necessary today what fear going happen that the advocates fiscal responsibilityand count myself among themmay prevent congress from giving the full level economic stimulus that need now fear that the stimulus will not big and fast need now and simultaneously fear that the advocates tax cuts and the advocates free spending will prevent from turning off the spigot later avoid this outcome the stimulus package should both temporary and selfreversing the same statute which provides huge amount stimulus should also provide particular identified tax increases and expenditure cuts that will into effect automatically the year the statute could and should provide that those automatic provisions would delayed failed achieve percent economic growth the year now course cant know today what the best budgetary policy for this country would have fine tune change anything that write today approaches but need give the upper hand those who would advocate fiscal responsibility after economic growth has resumed austerity mandated statute that goes into effect then the advocates fiscal responsibility will have that upper hand and can negotiate with our colleagues make sure that get the kind austerity that should follow the fiscal expansion that need now only economic stimulus proposal tough temporary and selfreversing can generate the political will necessary adopt proposal thats big enough and fast enough only stimulus measures are temporary and selfreversing can make sure that the actions take this month not eventually lead inflation higher interest rates declining dollar and enormous and permanent increase the federal debt these are the principles that think should guide with regard particular elements the stimulus bill now let look particular proposals are they efficient they get money into circulation quickly does every dollar spend forego get into the economy and get quickly second the money spent for good purpose third does the money stay the united states are going spending money the federal level that goes simply finance our trade deficit and finally are the provisions temporary and selfreversing first let talk about aid states this think the most important element the program because what could worse for economy facing contraction than see our police officers and teachers being laid off state and local governments just when need keep people employed provide aid states what about the efficiency think every state government going spend that money effectively those states that dont need may choose save for the future but there are very few those will the money put good use yes keep teachers and firefighters and police officers the payroll and all the job will the money stay the united states one hundred percent stays the united states and course this would temporary wanted could even make selfreversing most states are not allowed borrow money from the federal government their own constitutions but what could change the reimbursement formulas that take bigger share the medicaid budget than now and let the states save money that with the understanding that come not only does that formula back where was but may even swing the other direction and adverse the states they could plan for this this would way make the proposal state aid even selfreversing but its not selfreversing will temporary will efficient will good use money and the dollars will stay the united states second the possibility tax rebates consumers this money that will well spent americas families who need but cannot sure that they will spend may saved and have expect that the portion that will spent much will spent foreignmade goods may important provide these rebates consumers our society will help keep the retail economy going keep our shopping centers from going bankrupt cetera but let remember that chunk that money going overseas third element business tax breaks and here have draw distinction between those business tax breaks which the tax world call timing differences and those that are permanent tax reductions what are the timing differences timing difference when you give somebody deduction today that they would otherwise get tomorrow anyway you have simply changed the year which they get the tax reduction there are two proposals the table from the obama transition team that fit this bill one those changing the rules with regard investments believe its quarter million dollars let smaller businesses write this money off the year which they spend the money the absence special provision they would have capitalize that money and write off the asset they purchased used the machinery wears out well want encourage businesses invest now and ultimately costs little nothing yes give them the deduction right now this year otherwise they would take over period usually years why not give them the deduction now the ultimate increase the deficit over years very small now true that theres time value money not getting tax dollars today and getting them instead several years from now that used thought cost the treasury because you have pay interest the money the federal government borrows but today the federal government borrowing money for amazingly low interest rates some the rate zero and the fact that will get the tax dollars collected from businesses years from right now rather than immediately scarcely increases the federal deficit another issue net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks these are companies that made money during the last years now theyre losing money theyre going lose money current tax law allows them write off those losses chiefly against money they make future years should allow these companies carry back use these net operating loss deductions now offset the taxes they paid prior years first regard this fair any accounting theorist will tell you that the use the year accounting period arbitrary that companies make and lose money cycles business cycles often last many years and you cannot say that anything but artificial say well you made money you lost money you made and lost money over period years that have artificially divided into month periods saying that you have pay money the taxes you made but cannot get immediate refund those taxes when you discover that really over the year period youve lost money not consistent with good accounting theory should allow net operating loss carryback the other thing these net operating loss deductions theyre going taken some point might well let them taken now and the ultimate increase the deficit very small those are two provisions that think will encourage business and will provide lot more money expenditures today than ultimate increase the deficit over year period look forward working with colleagues economip policy will have more details what ive talked about the web page bradsherman house gov this the beginning dialogue how deal with the greatest economic crisis that have faced the lifetimes all but the oldest members this body this point chairman like focus foreign policy and particularly the middle east again would point out that there are colleagues that would like yield them few minutes and they happen the floor they need only get attention now want commend the bush administration for its support israel during this difficult period now the press often the case beating israel due its lack understanding what happening and how interpret first let remember that over the last several years hamas has sent nearly rockets into israel thats times they have attempted murder but the press would have you believe that those attempts murder dont count because most them were unsuccessful this absurd the malice demonstrated the attempted murder and use the term murder explicitly here because every one those rockets was fired with only one intention kill israeli civilians not single one those rockets was targeted anything military the fact that they havent killed israelis does not reflect well their morality may reflect poorly their aim second and this undercovered the press the united nations has stated that roughly threequarters the casualties gaza are terroristsmilitary guntoting hamas terrorists this true tribute the tactics used israel because israel has done everything possible avoid civilian casualties hamas has done everything possible increase civilian casualties again and again they fire rockets from the middle schools from the middle hospitals from the middle residential neighborhoods mean these people live very close each other israel actually has the gaza phonebook they will call house and say know military supplies are being stored there were going hit this house youve got minutes leave and what happens hamas forces civilians the rooftops perhaps one the bestknown examples the highest level hamas individual killed israel his home stored rockets and israel knew announced publicly that wanted martyr and that himself would his home and israel called that home and said want avoid civilian casualties have hit that home because know that rockets are being stored there you have time leave what did this hamas leader forced and brought together his four wives and their many children and insisted that allowed die martyr and that many his family members would die possible order increase civilian casualties now wellknown that israel allowing trucks supplies get into gaza this usually known presscritics who say israel didnt allow resupply truck this particular hour they made the truck wait couple hours let compare this the wars are most familiar with world war and world war during each those wars britain used its entire navy cut off every german civilian from food imports and any other kind import and germany deployed its submarines with the sole effort depriving the british the food imports they needed from chiefly the new world the wars were most familiar with both the good and the bad side did everything possible stop civilian supplies from getting into germany britain compare that israel that protects the trucks they with that like yield the gentleman from georgia
thank the gentleman for yielding appreciate democratic colleague for bringing this very important issue the forefront and support your effort and trust thatwe across the aisle can continue support israel the torah the old testament the bible read blessed the nation that blesses israel and cursed the nation that curses israel nation have been extremely blessed our creator god and believe big part that huge part that because have blessed israel and supported israel these people are under attack terrorists who consider jewish people dogs less than human and need support israel highly congratulate democratic colleague for bringing this forward and encourage our colleagues continue support israel continue what can make sure that the israeli citizens remain safe against these heinous attacks hamas hezbollah the iranian people who are funding both organizations need absolutely continue support israel that god will continue support america and congratulate colleague for bringing this forward and look forward working with you continue support israel thank you
look forward working with the gentleman from georgia and thank him for his remarks any discussion the morality war sometimes gets off what think sidelight people always want criticize this that sergeant this that gunner you shouldnt have responded this way rocks being thrown your attempt return fire hamas rocket site was off yards yards the direction civilian location have remember the moral responsibility for war and for the deaths war cannot placed the feet this that sergeant making this that decision under lifethreatening conditions the moral responsibility for war and for its casualties must placed politicians who seek extreme and unjust objectives through violent means heres case where hamas has earned its designation teirorist organization not only does use terrorist means but what are its objectives they are stated very clearly they are for the death expulsion every jew from the middle east they refuse any change that policy whether genocide ethnic cleansing more likely combination the two these are the objectives hamas being pursued violent means obviously the fault the politicians hamas who seek these objectives that must held responsible for the resulting carnage need sustainable permanent ceasefire not day resupply truce allow hamas bring more rockets now think its clear that this not just conflict between israel and hamas conflict between the government iran and the people the united states the fighting gaza has demonstrated again that the ultimate adversary the united states and its allies the middle east the government iran hamas terrorist organization seeking the destruction israel favor islamic palestinian state but also iranian proxy such part regional war waged the iranian regime against the united states and its allies many hamas weapons are made iran and many top hamas military leaders and the experts who launch the missiles into israel were trained iran iran also provides the group with significant funding unlikely that hamas would have been able achieve its status the premier palestinian terrorist organization and thus provoke this crisis without iranian backing iranbacked hamas like iranbacked hezbollah shoots rockets israeli civilians from deep inside their own densely populated civilian population knowing that when israel acts defend itself innocent palestinians will among the victims through hamas hezbollah and its operatives iraq iran and its government are able stir crises the middle east thus injuring american prestige while helping achieve that governments own aims know that iran working hard toward the possession nuclear bomb this would allow iran act with impunity the future nuclear iran would from provoking this crisis that crisis and would have facetoface with nuclear power each time hoping hoping for the same results saw the cuban missile crisisthat say going eyeballtoeyeball with hostile nuclear power hoping always have the same result namely some peaceful resolution only takes one crisis with nuclear power that goes the wrong direction destroy entire city entire country furthermore should recognize that the regime tehran ever finds itself the verge collapseand many pray for that dayits leaders may decide out with bang preventing iranian nuclear possession critical world peace and can still succeed accomplishing that goal but have act quickly the good news have used only percent the tools that are available and therefore can lot more the bad news weve used only about percent the tools available have demonstrated lack political will use the methods that have use put pressure the iranian regime now presidentelect obama has strong record working put pressure the iranian regime voted for the lautenberg amendment which would have prevented oil companies from doing business with iran through their foreign subsidiaries and authored bill that would have encouraged divestment from firmschiefly oil companiesdoing business with iran will have the ability when takes office long way toward increasing the price the iranian government pays for its stance the nuclear issue and its support for terrorism first can stop oil companies from using their overseas subsidiaries from doing business with iran should also that legislation the administration can start enforcing the iran sanctions act can demand that the world bank stop dispersing funds iran the form concessionary loans which have not been effectively opposed the current administration can deny nuclear cooperation agreements countries that provide technologies iran can deny insurance ships that carry cargo iran and can put economic pressure american foreign companies seeking build liquefied natural gas plants iran and those that sell refined petroleumchiefly gasolfneto iran now while iran oil rich needs import nearly half its gasoline because lacks refinery capacity here bring the houses attention one recent success the indian press reporting that result pressure that was initiated the congress major indian petroleum refinery halting its business dealings with iran want thank the several colleagues who joined with sending letter the importexport bank demand that exim not provide loans this particular indian refinery long the indian refinery was supporting iran and providing with the gasoline needs look forward being able convince iranian elites that they face other economic and diplomatic isolation they continue their nuclear program and continue their support for terror and there are many other ways that can achieve that objective invite colleagues again see more details bradsherman house gov

president senator john kerry has been open and very forward thinking this issue along with senator lugar supports this resolution ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed the consideration res submitted earlier senators reid and mcconnell
president res the resolution that was adopted today reaffirming support for israel factually accurate one here doubts our commitment israels security israels right defend itself from hamas rocket attacks but the resolution unfortunately presents incomplete response the situation gaza with much stake for the united states for israel and for the world owe the american people and all concerned cleareyed forthright and constructive discussion such vital matters these hamass unilateral decision break the ceasefire was deplorable clear that rather than work for peace hamas used the ceasefire amass more powerful and longer range weapons its actions should universally condemned and they will achieve nothing positive for the cause the palestinian people those who have collaborated supplying weapons that are being used terrorize and harm innocent civilians israel are complicit the suffering and destruction that has occurred both sides for its part israel used the ceasefire pressure hamas through blockade that the absence longterm strategy has caused extreme hardship for the palestinian people collectively gaza but done nothing change hamass militant policies the blockade was not coupled with effective strategy address the underlying causes the conflict the past days according the united nations palestinians have died including children result israels military operations and thousands more have been injured palestinian homes schools and other civilian infrastructure have been demolished among israelis three civilians have been killed and seven soldiers have died israeli homes have also been badly damaged from hamas rocket fire the relief and works agency which the principal humanitarian organization functioning gaza suspended its operations earlier today due risks the safety its personnel result israeli attacks which killed two its workers and injured one has been said here repeatedly israel has the right defend itself and have doubt that the israeli defense forces using powerful weapons supplied the united states can achieve tactical victories gaza damaging hamass military capabilities but the right response one that will over the long term make israel more secure and that will achieved only when israel accepted its neighbors those who have long worked support israel should not lose sight this crucial goal and this bigger picture this escalation will fear have the opposite effect the widening use force has implications for israels longterm security that should concern each this approach may increase support among palestinians for hamas well anger and resentment toward israel and the united states within arab countries and around the world israel seeks deal fatal blow hamas militants bomb them into submission and moderation our country were attacked similar way one our neighbors might respond the same way but there little any reason believe these tactics can work this latest escalation with bombs falling and tank artillery striking heavily populated areas where civiliansmore than half whom are childrenhave means escape obviously and tangibly providing ammunition extremists inside and outside gaza and doing increases the dangers both soldiers and civilians israeli and palestinianand miring israel openended mission gaza resulting far more destruction and loss innocent life than have seen far ultimately extremism what has hindered political resolution that ends this conflict with two secure states living side side there are some who may argue that the collapse the recent ceasefire proves that hamas will only respond force hamas has abused the ceasefire but that not the only lesson from the collapse any cleareyed analysis will show that ceasefire cannot succeedindeed will exploited israels enemiesif treated end itself instead opportunity materially improve the humanitarian situation and undertake serious negotiations end the conflict there are broadly acknowledged immediate steps that must taken put meaningful ceasefire place stop the smuggling weapons into gaza and open crossings into gaza facilitate the flow licit goods and services but beyond that history has shown that absent inclusive diplomatic process that effectively addresses the core interests both israelis and palestinians the cycle violence will continue preconditions are obstacle that process the middle east much they were for another seemingly intractable conflict northern ireland others have asked these questions which are worth repeating does the gaza war improve israels longterm even shortterm security was realistic and israels longterm interests expect hamas accept israel advance negotiations rather than push for total cessation the use violence and blockade followed negotiations was realistic expect the ceasefire hold while gaza remained under siege rife with hunger illness joblessness and hopelessness and while construction settlements continued and even accelerated the west bank january secretary state rice spoke the security council not doubt the sincerity her concern with the humanitarian situation gaza for the need for ceasefire that can endure and bring real security all want that but her words were noteworthy for what they said about the dismal failure the bush administrations approach the middle east conflict eight years were squandered and mishandled and presidentelect obama faces far more difficult situation than his predecessor inherited our credibility the entire world has suffered immeasurably since particular our image predominantly muslim countries has been affected the failure advance credible strategy help resolve the israelpalestinian conflict this has pronounced and obvious implications for our security for israels security and for the entire middle east region this time great opportunity america change our policies and make true contribution peace the middle east should careful when adopt resolutions subjects sensitive this cognizant the history the region and the complexities the situation above all our goal should enhance our role force for peace and our ability advance our nations interests

president want follow the comments friend from new hampshire senator gregg although and may disagree some political issues and the fact many the things just said agree with completely think there sense among members congress that are facing extraordinary set circumstances america today the presiding officer from the state michigan probably has endured more economic bad news than almost any not mistaken one out every eight people his state currently food stamps and indication how his economy struggling with regard the economies some the other states when you look across the united states the headlines are sobering have been told repeatedly about the loss jobs look some the most recent headlines dhl cuts jobs chrysler lay off fenton announcing job cuts sprint lqsing jobs stanley works office depotthe list goes and the fact yesterday americans lost their jobs the latest projections are true more americans will lose their jobs today and more americans will lose their jobs tomorrow that the state the economy instead creating employment are losing jobs pace which sobers all student history understand the great depression that franklin roosevelt inherited became president march was much deeper and dangerous and wider scope but when you look what face today that the only historical analogy can point recent memory that even close what are facing over american families lost their homes foreclosure yesterday more than families will lose their homes today and another the day after and every day that succeeds the reason course that have many bad mortgagesthe subprime mortgages many people were misled into signing for mortgages they couldnt afford and now the terms reset and come due families cant keep with them and are losing homes not just problem for that person who lives down the street the family who had move out your problem too hometown springfield small midwestern town with relatively stable real estate values home diminished value because the foreclosures that are occurring our community and the general state the economy even families dutifully making their mortgage payments are falling behind because their core assets such the value their home are diminishing every day this economic crisis deepens and claims more victims families who have worked hard for many years are finding difficult maintain even the most basic standards the middle class this the worst economic time our nation has seen since the great depression years ago can observe lament give our speeches about can something this morning presidentelect barack obama former illinois senate colleague gave speech george mason university right outside washington fairfax talked about what are facing and what need about said equally certain are the consequences doing little nothing all for that will lead even greater deficit jobs incomes and confidence the economy presidentelect obama said that why need act boldly and act now reverse these cycles thats why need put money the pockets the american people create new jobs and invest our future thats why need restart the flow credit and restore the rules the road that will ensure crisis like this never happens again that work begins with plan plan that says confident will save create least million jobs over the next few years talks about the priorities need invest such energy and education health care and new infrastructure that are necessary keep strong and competitive the century yesterday the designate for the new secretary energy steven chu came office man who widely respected for his academic expertise and knowledge energy issues finds little challenging and daunting thinks about facing members congress and the massive level employment personnel his department but talked terms energy and said ironic have reached point history that the united states not the cutting edge developing new forms energy technology the windmills are constructing across america are and large built designed europe nuclear energy have not touched for some years this country and have ceded the research other countries there are areas where need invest america presidentelect obama said this morning george mason university this energy investment important for our future move toward energy independence presidentelect obama few days will take the oath office not far from here and then will count congress move quickly pass the american recovery and reinvestment plan urging boldly and swiftly and that bring transparency and openness the process the american people see their money being well spent investments americas futureinvestments when comes education and energy and health care investments that will bring down the cost health care for many american families who are struggling today not mention those who have health protection whatsoever also calls stabilize and repair our financial system which all depend think know what are talking about when man named bernard madoff can over the span years lure investors into what has turned out ponzi scheme causing many them lose millions dollars and his wrongdoing goes unnoticed major regulatory agencies such the securities and exchange commission clear more has done when the ratings agencies major ratings agencies that set the standards for whether company doing well basically ignore their responsibility and fail make accurate reports everyone loses result presidentelect obama said closing today time set new course for this economy and that change must begin now should have open and honest discussion about this recovery plan the days ahead but urge congress move quickly possible behalf the american people for every day wait point fingers drag our feet more americans will lose their jobs more families will lose their savings more dreams will deferred and denied and our nation will sink deeper into crisis that some point may not able reverse hope what about say reminder all the responsibility face this new session are all concerned about the size the economic stimulus plan eight years ago the federal government was actually running budget surplus today estimate budget deficit the end the year trillion that deficit reflection poor choices that have been made many levels government but cannot let the bad choices the past prevent from making the wise choices have make now end this economic crisis interesting that economists from all across the political spectrum have come the same conclusion about what america needs nobel prizewinning economist paul krugman who put the category liberal democrat said recently much better depressed economy err the side too much stimulus than the side too little publicly wondered whether threequarters trillion dollars enough martin feldstein president reagans chief economic adviser said without action the economy will continue decline rapidly mark zandi who advised senator mccain during his campaign said advice err the side too big package rather than too little all the great minds economic thinkers are coming the same conclusion need act act decisively and act boldly but need act responsibly too not have day waste but not have taxpayer dollar waste either have make sure the dollars are well spent not the creation government agencies but the creation goodpaying jobs right here america not investments bureaucracy but investments our economy that will help our nation grow the years come need include smart spending and targeted tax cuts for the middle class they can cope with the challenges the economic challenges they face have make sure the money that spent congress spent responsibly not end with embarrassing earmark projects that have not been subjected public scrutiny and review advance need make sure programs are authorized and funds are pumped quickly into the economy but efficient way need invest jobs for american workers states have identified almost billion road and bridge projects ready launch within days every billion federal funds can create private sector goodpaying american jobs and generate billion economic activity there lot work our states are struggling they dont have the money keep the safety net americans will need the economy weakens they cannot help colleges and universities that need helping hand nineteen states are considering cutbacks basic health care states are cutting services for the elderly states are cutting proposing cut through and early childhood education the list goes and see colleague from montana and will happy take the chair can continue his remarks necessary but the last point will make that the mortgage foreclosure crisis the core our problems america cannot come grips with rebirth the american economy without dealing with the mortgage foreclosure crisis crisis that mentioned earlier hurts the families losing their homes and those living the neighborhoods and towns around them are all this together what need work with major financial institutions renegotiate these mortgages people who still have job and can make reasonable mortgage payment can stay their homes got off the phone with one the major bankers the city chicago friend mine said get are going have thing much more boldly deal with mortgage foreclosure the programs put together the voluntary programs have not worked they have not touched enough people more and more homes are facing foreclosure more people are heading bankruptcy and that has come end the housing industry much like the automobile industry one the staples our economy and have deal with putting back track last month credit suisse estimated million homes were likely lost foreclosure the economy continues worsen they believe foreclosures will exceed million homes are going have come with the money turn this economy around will mean more debt the short term but the economy starts moving forward again frankly the only thing that can look the long term for americas future urge colleagues the senate democrats and

president few days ago all counted down the final seconds israel they had something else count all through last year from january until december terrorist group launched more than rockets and mortar shells into israeli cities these were deliberate acts violence provocation and murder the group responsible was hamas hamas terrorist organization founded one principal goal destroying the state israel its charter says there value international conferences political initiatives dialogue says there only one approach the political situation the middle east and that jihad was surprise when the terrorist group hamas staged illegal coup against the forces president mahmoud abbas the legitimate president the palestinian people was surprise that hamas rejected egyptian and arabian calls for extension the ceasefire egypt had negotiated was surprise that when israel voluntarily and unilaterally dismantled settlements and withdrew from gaza that hamas saw this not opportunity build peace but instigate war continue terrorize and kill israelis their places worship their schools and their homes since that year hamas terrorists have used gaza fire more than mortars and rockets into israel reaching major cities and pushing ever closer the capital country would expected sit its hands and simply allow its citizens endure these kinds vicious attacks without taking action stop the responsible party sitting new jersey and rockets are landing around house near children and near our schools goal immediate goal stop the rockets december israel sent its military gaza achieve direct goal stop the rockets and now all hope strongly that this goal can achieved quickly possible but recognize must pursued israel have the sovereign right protect itself and its citizens israels acts stop the hamas rocket attacks are response the daily risk death faced the israeli citizens who live within rocket range these innocent civilians have been forced live constantly under the threat mass casualties nationno nationshould have wait for the death toll rise enough before can act nation needs wait until enough schoolchildren have fallen victim rocket attack before stops rockets from falling its cities the launching rockets and mortar fire invasion israels sovereign territory different from dropping bombs out airplanes different from any other act war there question that israel has right and obligation defend its people mourn the loss all innocent life and the death palestinian civilians result this conflict tragic there are great many palestinians gaza and the west bank who completely reject the hamas ideology they want live peace and build the palestinian state for themselves and for their children they are however hamas hostages hamas has hijacked gaza not build state which you can live peace and prosperity but use base launch attacks against innocent civilians israel let remember was hamas that chose end the ceasefire hamas that chose fire continuous barrage rockets date hamas that deliberately uses civilians human shields and launches its attacks from heavily populated civilian areas putting them risk hamas that has spent its money rockets rather than food for the hungry hamas that would rather focus the rhetoric that calls for the destruction the state israel than relief for its own people israel and the united states have proven their commitment helping innocent civilians gaza stark contrast the terrorist group hamas israel has taken significant steps prevent civilian casualties they give warnings impending attacks they drop leaflets and make phone calls targeted areas warn the citizens they are danger even that means losing the element surprise and putting the lives their own soldiers risk israel and the united states have actively provided humanitarian assistance gaza since december tons humanitarian aid have been delivered gaza coordination with israel the palestinian authority international organizations and various other donors the united states government through the agency for international development continuing deliver humanitarian supplies the people gaza the united states has provided medical and food supplies health care facilities support the the international committee the red cross and other nongovernmental organizations they continue their relief efforts all want peace gaza and hope can come very soon but peace cannot achieved long hamas continues its missile attacks just and lasting ceasefire occur incumbent upon hamas immediately and permanently halt all attacks against the israeli people rise today express unwavering commitment the welfare security and survival the state israel jewish and democratic state that what the resolution before affirms the resolution states the ultimate goal the united states sustainable resolution the israelipalestinian conflict that will allow for viable and independent palestinian state living side side peace and security with the state israel this will not possible long israeli civilians are under threat from rockets this resolution correctly lays out hamas must end the rocket and mortar attacks against israel recognize israels right exist renounce violence and agree accept previous agreements between israel and the palestinians today the senate must stand support the state israel stand support its right defend itself against terrorists stand support its right exist having said all this course urge israel defends its sovereignty and its people use every option can limit the loss innocent lives let vote for resolution that demonstrates our commitment one the strongest allies the united states america has the world and let all can make peaceful yield the floor and suggest the absence quorum
president ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call rescinded
president would like speak two subjects the first deals with resolution the senate unanimously adopted this morning president today the senate approved resolution recognizing the right israel defend itself against terrorist attacks from gaza and reaffirming the united states strong support for israel its battle with hamas the first thing the resolution does remind people why the state israel had act israel has had endure more than rocket and mortar attacks its citizens since fully withdrew from gaza fact the town sderot which about miles from the border gaza has been suffering for over years from these attacks there any doubt that the united states were suffering attack from just across the border similar what israel facing that wouldnt react stop that from happening think there question that would act stop this terrorism and this resolution expresses the united states support israels right defend itself the second point the resolution makes that there equivalency between the terrorist actions hamas and the defensive actions israel israel conducts its military operations spare innocent life has specifically targeted hamas command centers security installations rocketlaunching sites weapons stockpiles and weapons smuggling tunnels has tried very hard avoid civilian casualties hamas the other hand deliberately and maliciously fires rockets into civilian areas from civilian areas thereby making more difficult for israel target the terrorists and increasing the likelihood civilian casualties when israel does take action finally this resolution speaks calls for ceasefire many voices the international community have been heard pleading for immediate ceasefire although think instructive that one never hears those voices condemning rocket attacks hamas terrorists believe the path halt the violence clear ceasefire appropriate and when durable and sustainable precipitous ceasefire the other hand that would allow hamas rearm and rebuild its support gaza not acceptable hamas cannot given ceasefire that only serves provide breathing room regroup and then start firing its rockets and missiles again adopting this resolution have said the israeli people stand with you and support you defending yourselves against terrorists short the resolution expresses strong support for the defense israel its military action today the gaza strip the fact that has been repeatedly attacked hamas terrorists from the gaza strip and finally decided that the only way stop those attacks its citizens was into gaza and try remove the weapons and the launching sites and try arrest the terrorists who were involved the launching those rockets this resolution expresses strong support for israel reminds all why israel was forced act makes the point that there equivalency between the action the israelis and the terrorist action hamas which deliberately seeks harm civilians finally speaks the question ceasefire noting that the position the united states correctly that ceasefire could only supported durable and sustainable other words ensures that the conditions that created the controversy today are not simply repeated another months from now when the hamas terrorists have had opportunity rearm pleased the senate has spoken such timely fashion this important issue commend colleagues for supporting the resolution
president the presidentelect spoke the stimulus package today the finance committee had informal meeting today discuss the proposition its outlines are still quite vague there specificity what precisely will into the stimulus package but there are some general concepts emerging what wanted today very briefly outline what think would some sensible tests evaluate what being proposed and what may reveal that some ideas would not meet these tests and should not part stimulus package others would meet the tests and would help resolve the economic crisis that faces america today think the context put this one which have already had some bailouts and americans are little suspicious that some the money have committed these bailohts going helpthe billion bailout fannie mae and freddie mac the billion bailout aig the insurance company the billion troubled asset relief program the recent billion auto bailout and the way the announcement yesterday was that for the first time the history the world the budget deficit countrynamely the united states americawill top trillion that over percent our gross domestic product friend mine reminded todayi think interesting bit trivia trillion more money than all the cash circulation the world today the united states america all the dollar bills the tendollar bills the hundreddollar bills and all the quarters nickles and all the other cash the united states does not equal trillion and that how much the deficit going for just this current year that lot money that context have very careful about how spend another trillion thereabouts stimulate the economy the money comes from somewhere and either comes from taxpayers directly the form increased taxes borrowed and the taxpayers eventually have pay that back with interest the interest cost the way expected well over billion result have very careful that more good than harm taking this money away from american taxpayers the first test obviously will work will stimulate economic growth that the test that larry summers adviser the presidentelect has stated fact said and paraphrasing that investments will chosen strategically the basis which will the most spur the economy have tried something before and has not worked good sign that probably should not that the reason say that had stimulus already the socalled tax rebate spent billion the facts ate now did not work did not stimulate the economy fact only about percent the money turns out have been spent the lesson learned situation like this you have tried something before and has not worked then not repeat because throwing good money after bad the reason did not work because when people get onetime windfall they tend save pay bills with they spend they believe that permanent part their income forever more going relate their taxes need ensure that they know that they are going have permanent tax relief simply something they believe they are going have for year two chances are they are not going spend not going any good another test would government action better the private sector the government sector know america small business and some big business our free enterprise system that creates jobs that creates economic growth the government cannot create economic growth fact when the government gets involved there more potential harm than good can tax them dan regulate them usually does not them any good sometimes you can things help business usually you way that helps with their tax burden there are some good ideas that have heard discussed that would making more tax friendly invest certain kinds equipment for example hire more people knew that would stimulate economic activity that those kind activities would very useful but frequently when spend government money this case for example potentially creating new government jobs remember are taking that money out the private sector and likely less good the public sector than would left the private sector fact couple economists with whom spoke yesterday noted that even recession business gets percent return its investment the real test should the money spent the government sector will get least that return the investment that are making not should leave that money the private sector the private sector can get that return that investment and therefore generate more economic activity our private enterprise system another question whether the new government spending replaces state and local spending understanding there big chunk money state and local governments now they have gotten themselves into pickle because lot them have big budget deficits this year they are going constrict what they spend money well they are going have raise taxes fees find some other way balance their budgets but they obviously would like for the federal government bail them out well obviously before the federal government considers doing that the first question are you going correct what has created the deficiency the first place are simply going save your bacon then you not have anything change your ways are you going reduce your spending for example are you going spend the money anyway people are talking about shovelready projects there are lot shovelready projects the state level for roads highways whatever and they are called shovelready because the state prepared them well the state going them anyway then clearly the federal government paying for not going create any new jobs not going stimulate economic growth any way even though might produce new bridge new highway that useful the people that state since our goal stimulate new economic activity must ask whether the spending will really create new economic activity merely replace something the state level that would occur anyway the penultimate question worth doing have ask the taxpayers from whom are getting money whether investment worth undertaking all for example one the things that would infrastructure todo list was mob museum las vegas there was snowmaking venture minnesota are these the kind investments that american taxpayers believe are warranted under any circumstances there are lot investments the federal government can make that are worthwhile for example clearly have used lot military equipment that needs replaced there are good jobs throughout this country producing military equipment need add personnel our military think there general consensus that that will cost money that will obviously create jobs those are activities that are needed are worthwhile are job creating and clearly would help our country potentially being much more worthwhile than like say mob museum some kind snowmaking equipment then finally think there one final test that might talk about view the huge deficit have should make the deficit worse this costbenefit analysis this clearly going added the deficit the question how much more deficit can pile without having adverse consequences the immediate and longterm might stimulate the economy over the next months but are creating huge hole dig out years from now have ask really going worth when evaluate the different proposals have ask whether going worth have this large deficit twice the trillion this coming year one thought this regard this when lower tax rates know helps people helps small business create jobs that what you recession you try help people letting them keep more their money they can spend and help get out the recession permanent tax cuts are the way that the permanent tax cut obviously may may not reduce revenue the treasury the right kind tax cuts can actually produce more revenue the treasury but increased spending there way around loses money the treasury puts you deeper hole between the potential relief from taxes leaving more money the private sector which eventually going create the jobs get out the recession having the government spend more money and creating larger deficit that way test that think need very clear about from mind while willing help things stimulate economic activity the short term not willing ignore longterm consequences deficit the size that would created the kind spending are talking about apply the right kind testsand they are sensible they are not republican democratic tests they are obviously tests that any prudent person would ask before spending this kind moneyi think that will help better evaluate the kind economic stimulus package can actually support the senate will the kind analysis our taxpaying constituents expect when view all the other things that have been done bail out vari aspects our economy with the kind trilliondollarplus deficit are looking they want engage they want prudent they have had their fill wasteful washington spending they want very careful about what with their money the future hope engage this debate the futurewe will have plenty time talk about debate think about analyze and not suggesting try slowwalk but trying move quickly nevertheless take the time perform the kind analysis have talked about yield the floor and suggestthe absence quorum

basic treatment needs stay healthy also heard from the proud owner small bookkeeping and tax preparation business warwick she has worked tirelessly raise five sons back college and finally she has become her own boss yet despite all her effort and all her success she wrote plead for reform she wrote this spend over percent income just have health insurance for husband and myself the premiums are over per month even with very high deductibles employees need health insurance also but unable provide them with any benefits because the poor economic conditions her employees are like family her with many small businesses and breaks her heart that they are uninsured yet she says she simply will not able keep her doors open she tried contribute toward their benefits the midst this economic downturn and particularly rhode island where the unemployment rate one the highest the nation this story shows all too clearly how closely linked are the tasks reforming our health care system and strengthening our economy our health care system manages fail even those who believe themselves covered woman who lives woonsocket and who has health insurance and was always careful pay her bills time assumed she would covered the event emergency why not she was current she paid her premiums she had insurance but not too long ago she suddenly had have her appendix removed despite having health insurance she left that hospital with bill she currently working for temp service and she has idea how she can pay off this debt she had recently bought her own home longtime dream and accomplishment which she took great pride now because the fine print that health insurance policy she risks losing the home she worked long afford this rhode islander learned the hardest way possible health insurance often ends ensuring very little behalf these rhode islanders and many others that urge colleagues come together support health care reform that will lower costs and improve the quality care for all americans must improve the way deliver health care promoting quality implementing health information technology and investing preventing disease must and will protect existing coverage when good must improve when not and must guarantee health care for the million americans million whom are children who have health insurance all see ourselves now darkening and tumultuous economic times yet looking beyond the immediate economic perils face there trillion unfunded liability for medicare that bearing down bearing down because our population aging because people get sicker they age and that makes them more expensive unless figure out way this chamber stop time unless figure out way this chamber reverse the aging process unless figure out way this chamber make elders have healthier lives and bodies than younger people this inevitable coming and have prepare order prepare have reform the health care delivery system are committed democrats making sure every american has health insurance coverage but not enough just bring everyone into the boat you had boat the ocean and people swimming around and save them you needed bring them into the boat you would that but the boat itself was sinking the boat itself was fire just bringing everybody into the boat not adequate discharge your duties also important that you repair the boat that you get steaming forward that you make sure safe for the people whom you bring into that means reforming our health information technology infrastructure every american can count electronic health record when you see your doctor you dont have fill out that clipboard one time after another when the same time you can sign amazon and not only they know who you are they know what you have bought and they have suggestions for you based your buying habits there excuse for our health care system being back the the rest the economy moves forward into the century requires improving the quality health care and requires investing prevention dramatically underinvest prevention and quality there are market failures that cause those things happen they are repairable addition the cost savings estimated that americans die every year americans die every yearbecause avoidable medical errors simply not tolerable allow that continue particularly when winwin situation where improved quality care means lower costs finally the third leg the reform addition helping infrastructure technology and quality and prevention reform that have reform how pay for health care align the price signal that send those payments with what want from health care until that will constantly struggling uphill against our own financial message this all doable this all doable but will take time these are complex matters will have make adjustments the adjustments will take time dynamic environment which will have make course corrections along the way that means need start now not have the luxury time our side not get started thoroughgoing health care delivery system reform now then the alternative will times that are even darker and more tumultuous than find ourselves right now see the very distinguished chairman the budget committee the floor man who eloquent voice the dark and tumultuous times and the risks face from the current fiscal situation will gladly yield this point and thank the presiding officer
madam president first all wish thank senator whitehouse for his contributions this chamber has been outstanding member serves the budget committee with has developed special expertise health care which badly needed wish comment very briefly the cbo report received today the budget committee hearing the fiscal outlook truly jawdropping there trillion deficit for this year before any economic recovery package passed add the debt even higher trillion will added the debt the country and again that before any cost economic recovery plan one factors economic recovery plan could looking increase the debt trillion this year alone put that context have gross debt the united states trillion roughly today think imperative that while put together economic recovery plan which must also are cognizant the very serious longterm fiscal condition face nation there frontpage story the new york times today indicating that the chinese the biggest financers our debt have reduced appetite for american dollardenominated debt because they have their own economic issues their own need for the use capital home this could have enormous consequences for going forward terms interest rates and what will take attract foreign capital float this economic boat one final point last year the new debt financing for this country percent came from abroad madam president percent our new debt financing came from abroad the fact that the chinese who have been the most significant contributors financing that debt are expressing reluctance take more our debt more our debt financing should send warning signal all fashion longterm fiscal and economic policy yield the floor
madam president wish ask through the chair question the distinguished chairman the budget committee with respect the trillion debt the country now carrying the time the current administration that leaving office came into office years ago understanding the situation america was rather different understanding that that time were actually looking surpluses our country and the trillion deficit largely the responsibility the policies that have been followed over the past years
the senator exactly right the debt the country the beginning the last administration was about trillion they have approximately doubled the debt the country their watch dramatically more than doubled foreign holdings debt the current administration the outgoing administration has left the incoming administration very deep hole not mention the economic difficulties and the extreme need for economic recovery plan give lift this economy
through the good times could have been laying money aside that when this situation came would strong economic condition instead squandering all those years have put the incoming administration very challenging position
yes not only the incoming administration the whole country because our ability cope with economic downturn the flexibility substantially limited what has already been done dramatically increase the debt the senator described good economic times unfortunately that the reality now confront todays news the congressional budget office not only the trillion deficit this year but massive deficits fax the eye can see should sober all
thank the very distinguished chairman the budget committee for being willing engage this colloquy with
thank the senator from rhode island and look forward working with him the budget committee attempt come with plan deal with these multiple challenges
madam president under the rules have been quorum call recess
madam president first all appreciate your coming from your meeting preside begin the new congress and new administration begin new chapter energy and environmental policy and time that environmental activists the united nations and many democratic colleagues have been salivating for for years the stars are all aligned democrats control both sides pennsylvania avenue and the supreme court has spoken now that carbon dioxide pollutant under the clear air act even though was decision kind interesting how something can pollutant with decision believed the stage has been set for home run mandatory kyotolike climate controls and the dawn new bustling green energy economy however before many colleagues rush leap before they look wish remind them some very unfortunate developments that may complicate their early action items their wish lists ask colleagues least consider some the facts will revealing over the next series speeches and keep open mind before rushing sweeping action after waiting for many years the scale and pace the climate proposals and the regulatory actions have debated the past including the recently failed liebermanwdrner bill and the ones will likely debating this congress leave little room for error this fragile recessionridden economy and the inflated promises sweeping green jobs revolution need honest and frank reality the proponents mandatory global warming controls need honest with the american people the purpose these programs ration fossilbased energy making more expensive and therefore less appealing for public consumption regressive tax that imposes greater burden relative resources the poor than does the rich let say that again the purpose these programs ration the fossil fuelbased energy making more expensive all americans and therefore less appealing for public consumption but regressive tax and have talked about this before one that punishes those whose resources have used for such purposes being able operate their vehicles and heat their homes advocates may argue that the redistribution wealth toward the income consumers will offset the balance revenue taxes being taken but learned firsthand during the liebermanwarner debate that this simply not true dont like the argument that have equal distribution wealth efforts that are going take regressive nature out the punitive values this type program there something unamerican about that but while the bills sponsors try convince there actually tax relief the bill learn that families now talking about the liebeimanwarner bill and this was only about months ago the liebermanwarner billwe learn that families with workers will still have pay trillion into the system the form higher energy costs get back estimated billion tax relief that return out every paid time that proponents climate policies honest expensive and going cost taxpayers lot money you know doesnt really matter which form use have gone through first all the kyoto treaty came this close passing the kyoto treaty and wasnt until the wharton school economics came along with the econometrics survey and they determined would cost some billion year join onto and actually try achieve the emission requirements kyoto then along came the mccainlieberman bill and then after that the warnerlieberman bill and cap and trade going about the same amount they may massage little bit but are still talking the neighborhood billion year that equates over for each taxpaying family america huge the coming weeks will into more detail about other false promises proponents mandatory global warming policies are advocating among them are reality check green projectsthe number new green jobs from climate regime are overstated compared the number manufacturing jobs lost and know from the national association manufacturers how many jobs would have been lost with any these schemes the past review the weaknesses offset policiescompanies have bought offsets which are not real and review the attempts estimate the cost inaction many advocates are claiming more expensive nothing than the cost cap and trade but they are untested and nontransparent economic modeling all these issues will play vital role the debate both energy and global warming policy which have become unavoidably intertwined you cant really talk about one without the other you cant talk about what you are going greenhouse gases cap and trade without affecting our overall energy policy when there are sensible proposals debated congress that can achieve double benefits reducing emissions and making americas energy supply more stable diverse and affordable then will look forward working bipartisan basis achieving these goals increasing our domestic energy production and lowering our dependence foreign oil are two issues that are critically important myself and state oklahoma and course this will include renewables and new green jobs however need smart and realistic about these policies unfortunately fear that the scale and pace many colleagues will advocating with mandatory climate policies are unrealistic extraordinarily narrowly expensive and illadvised what the driver for these unrealistic proposals that seem make unnecessarily abrupt and painful increases our energy costs the near term all rooted global warming science have given over speeches averaging over hour apiece the science global warming over the past few years today wish update colleagues some the latest science that has not yet been reported the mainstream media will simply disseminator this information and not commentator have say that becausei not scientist nor anyone else that know this body scientist the statements will make will quoting people who are qualified and are scientists and this what role will before that ask all colleagues think about the issue science should not reviewed through any one frame not partisan not regional however the political process has largely engulfed science behind climate change have documented speeches before the politicizing the global warming science has become one the most unfortunate developments the last years anytime one questions hypothesis conclusion that does not fall line with the sky falling doom and gloom scenario global warming alarmists ridiculed written off denigrated and not reported the mainstream media yet anytime more severe interpretation alarming statistic related headline grabbing the news objective transparent and verifiable science gets lost the public dialog funding has way influencing this debate the other day there was article the bloomberg newsand say this for those individuals who might feeling sorry for goreit was reported that his net worth was between million and million and now excess million today will all right when the stakes the policy outcomes with cap and trade and other mandatory climate proposals are this high for the american people hope the senate this year will embrace calls for objectivity and transparency science and modeling policymakers our duty make sure models developed agencies and used policy are useful for their intended purpose articulate major assumptions and uncertainties and separate scientific conclusions from policy judgments however with global warming science this has not been the case with many leftofcenter scientists the environmental activists now realize the socalled consensus manmade global warming not holding the leftwing blog huffington postthis leftleaning organizationsurprised lot people featuring article january harold ambler demanding apology from gore for promoting unfounded global warming fears the huffington postagain left leaningarticle accused gore telling the biggest whopper ever sold the american public the history mankind because claimed the science was settled global warming the huffington post article entitled gore apology accepted adds gore and his brethren who are flatearthers not the skeptics again not myself not jim inhofe saying this about gore the leftwing blog the huffington post saying these things the huffington post article continues let neither cripple our own economy mislabeling carbon dioxide pollutant nor discourage development the third world where suffering continues unabated day after day another leftofcenter atmospheric scientist who has descended the manmade climate fears the richard courtney and lets keep mind where all this started lot people forget this was started the united nations the united nations intergovernmental panel cli mate change they came out and said manmade gases anthropogenic gases methane that are causing climate change and this person used that panel was expert reviewer the based climate and atmospheric science consultant and selfdescribed socialist who also happens reject manmade climate fears joining courtney are many the other progressive environmental scientists former green peace member and finnish scientist jarl ahlbeck lecturer environmental technology and chemical engineer the university finland who has authored scientific publications also skeptical manmade climate doom ahlbeck wrote contrary common belief there has been little global warming since and this shown two completely independent data sets but far real measurements give ground for concern about catastrophic future warming this kind interesting because what sayingand this guy who started out with the united nations the beginning with the ipccis that right now are actually cooling period think one debates that now have had the most severe weather and will have another talk will try get next week about what happening around the country right now isnt global warming global cooling people forget god still there and through these cycles can remember the middle when they were saying there another ice age coming and are all going die those same peopleand there was article time magazine that timeare the ones now saying are going die but for different reas global warming lifelong liberal democrat martin hertzberg retired navy meteorologist with physical chemistry also declared his dissent warming fears said scientist and lifelong liberal democrat find the constant regurgitation the anecdotal fear mongering claptrap about humancaused global warming disservice science finally cnnnot bastion conservatismhad yet another its meteorologists dissent from warming fears meteorologist chad myers meteorologist for years certified the american meteorological society spoke out against anthropogenic climate claims cnn december you know think that could affect weather all that much pretty arrogant mother nature big the world big the oceans are bigi think are going die from the lack fresh water are going die from some type ocean acidification before die from global warming for sure myers joins fellow cnn meteorologistby the way cnn has been very biased all this time think know that has the weather channel because there lot money perpetuating this myth myers was joined his fellow cnn meteorologist rob marciano who compared gores film fiction and cnn anchor lou dobbs just said global warming fear promotion january this year its almost religion without any question recently released new report climate scientists which documents many the studies ignored the mainstream media here right here this one that actually too large put into the report are scientists who have challenged manmade global warming claims made the united nations intergovernmental panel climate change talked about that have been detailing these science issues for number years july floor speech this chamber said the issue global warming far from settled and indeed seriously disputed the science continues evolve explained that anyone who pays even cursory attention the issue understands that scientists vigorously disagree over whether human activities are responsible for global warming whether those activities will precipitate natural disasters notedand this what said not only there debate but least certain corridors the debate shifting away from those who subscribe global warming alarmism that was after that speech led the charge against the mccainlieberman global warming capandtrade billthat would then again both times easily defeating the bills the time was lonely battle only few people came down help the floor remember well when was alone down here the floor the senate for consecutive days that had the floor about hours day very few people came down and were willing join the senate floor that has changed you fastforward from had the warnerlieberman bill the floor that time had over senators come down and join you are seeing people who longer fear the money generated the moveon orgs the hollywood elitists those individuals who have millions dollars put into campaigns throw into the system are getting lot encouragement things have changed fact the end the bill that had that referred sometimes either the liebermanwarner bill the boxer climate tax bill they are only able get about people from their own party from this side the aisle over here who would support that major change from the past after this election that number has only gone from you are not getting close the votes necessary try inflict this economic damage the united states the republicans were prepared debate the billthis the warnerlieberman billanct were ready offer amendments but the democrats didnt want debate much less vote our amendments that were aimed protecting american families and workers from the devastating economic impacts the bill when faced with the inconvenient truth the bills impact skyrocketing gas prices was democratic senators who wanted see the bill die quick death the way had list some democratic senators who very responsible way said will ahead and vote some these amendments but when comes final passage are not going vote after the bill failed the wall street journal aptly noted that environmentalists are stunned that their global warming agenda collapse the paper added the green groups now look politically intimidating the skinny kid the beach who has sand kicked his face the paper quoted political analyst who noted that this issue starting feel like the hillary health care plan again despite the claims that must act now prevent climate crisis the climate tax bill would not have resulted any action whatsoever the bill often touted insurance policy against global warming would instead have been all economic pain and climate gain this because without global treaty the binding commitments both the developing and developed countries not going work lets say believed that manmade anthropogenic gases were the major cause climate change and the debate was over something just unilaterally the united states america all that would cause flight our manufacturing jobs overseas countries such india and china and mexicoplaces where they not have any kind restriction the greenhouse gases would have net increase were pass one these yet are the ones who would saddied with billionayear tax bill americans are suspicious the need for solutions global warming the gallup poll released earth day revealed the american publics concern about manmade global warminghas remained unchanged since according gallup and this quote from the report they said despite the enormous attention paid global warming over the past several years the average american some ways more worried about than they were years past other words after all the money all the hype all the biased media over the past few years people have not moved that direction they know better they know when they have been duped what perhaps the most striking that aside from the economics global warming solutions the science has continued move the direction predicted released senate minority report detailing over scientists disputing manmade global warming claims the inconvenient real world climate study developments are refuting global warming fears that was just year ago the tail end for the benefit public dissemination have updated our report and the socalled consensus global warming even more dispute that the report have right here over dissenting scientists from around the globe challenge manmade global warming claims made the united nations intergovernmental panel climate change and former vice president gore our new page senate minority report features the skeptical voices over prominent international scientists including many current and former ipcc scientists who have now turned against the ipcc this updated report includes additional and growing might add has grown since thenscientists and climate researchers since the initial release december the over dissenting scientists are more than times the number the scientists only themwho authored the mediahyped ipcc summary for policymakers this very significant know kind heavy lifting understand this but the ipcc that started this whole thing they have this analysis that made and updated but you never get the full report any the scientists merely the summary for policymakers that that for the politicians out there they only have scientists who signed this report are talking about scientists versus the chorus skeptical scientific voices grew louder steady stream peerreviewed studies analyses realworld data and inconvenient developments challenged the and former vice president gores claims that the science settled and there consensus despite what now being portrayed the media range issues proved devastating for the promoters manmade climate fears addition the following developments further secured the year the consensus collapsed russian scientists rejected the very idea that carbon dioxide may responsible for global warming frankly they laugh have had meetings with them they laugh milan when they had one the big united nations meetings where they tried coerce countries into supporting this the russians that time were position since they have these vast areas that are totally undevelopedi remember flying across siberia few years ago pilot and flew airplane across the world and remember flying across siberia and looking down and seeing time zone after time zone where you dont see any people nothing but natural resources yet all those would the formula they would great big recipients they are able get some kind international treaty addition that the american physical society editor conceded that considerable presence scientific skeptics exists international team scientists countered the ipcc declaring nature not human activity rules the climate india issued report challenging global warming fears team international scientists demanded the ipcc called account and cease its deceptive practices and canvass more than canadian scientists revealed that percent disagree that global warming science settled are not talking about politicians people senators like and others this room are talking about real scientists who are out there are talking about percent the scientists canada now have come recognize thfs that was not true years ago most were the other side this issue but they have now looked and realize they have been duped this new report the latest evidence the growing groundswell scientific opposition challenging significant aspects the claims the united nations ipcc and gore scientific meetings are now being dominated growing number skeptical scientists the prestigious international geological congress dubbed the geologists equivalent the olympic games and held very high esteem was held norway august just few months ago and prominently featured the voices scientists skeptical manmade global warming fears the conference was reportedly overwhelmed with skeptical scientists with twothirds the presenters and questionaskers who were hostiie even dismissive the united nations ipcc even the mainstream media began take notice the expanding number scientists serving consensus busters november article politicoeveryone washington reads thatnoted that growing accumulation science challenging warming fears and added that the science behind global warming may still too shaky warrant capandtrade legislation canadas national post noted october that the number climate change skeptics growing rapidly new york times environmental reporter andrew revkin noted march all know climate science not numbers game there are heaps signed statements folks with advanced degrees all sides this issue agree with him and its shame that have had resort numbers game should focused objective transparent and peer reviewed science and debate should not quarantined washington post staff writer juliet eilperin conceded the obvious writing that climate skeptics appear expanding rather than shrinking skeptical scientists are gaining recognition despite what many say bias against them parts the scientific community and are facing significant funding disadvantages william briggs climate statistician who serves the american meteorological societys probability and statistics committee explained that his colleagues described absolute horror stories what happened them when they tried getting papers published that explored nonconsensus views march report briggs described the behavior really outrageous and unethical the parts some editors was shocked again this not saying this there are scientists here are some the highlights senate minority report featuring over international scientists dissenting from manmade climate claims incidentally this report haveit was intention make this report these scientists part the record however very wisely this body has said not want the expense something like this would overwhelming that some senators who are conservatives would rather not the report here matter public record you can get lot this web site ewo senate com nobel prize winner for physics ivar giaever stated skeptic global warming has become new religion atmospheric scientist joanne simpson the first woman the world receive meteorology and formerly nasa who has authored more than studies and has been called among the most preeminent scientists the last years stated since longer affiliated with any organization nor receiving any funding can speak quite frankly scientist remain skeptical the main basis the claim that mans release greenhouse gases the cause the warming based almost entirely upon climate models all know the frailty models concerning the airsurface system here one can argue with simpson the united nations ipcc japanese scientist kiminori itoh awardwinning environmental physical chemist statedthis from all over the world now this japan warming fears are the worst scientific scandal the history when people come know what the truth they will feel deceived science and scientists indian geologist arun ahluwalia punjab university and board member the supported international year the planet stated the ipcc has actually become closed circuit does not listen others does not have open minds really amazed that the nobel peace price has been given scientifically incorrect conclusions people who are not geologists solar physicist pal brekke senior advisor the norwegian space center oslo has published more than peerreviewed scientific articles the sun and solar interaction with the earth brekke stated anyone who claims that the debate over and the conclusions are firm has fundamentally unscientific approach one the most momentous issues our time these are all top scientists one can discredit these people you might wonder why that many people want believe that maybe bad old man responsible for those horrible things that are going happen that are not going happen there are lot reasons for that lot money behind this comes from organizations such those find some the hollywood groups moveon org george soros and different foundations such the hines foundation that want stop the progress this country but anyway back some these scientists victor manuel velasco herrera researcher the institute geophysics the national autonomous university mexicoi covering all these countries now these are the top scientists these countriesstates models and forecasts the ipcc are incorrect because they only are based mathematical models and presented results and scenarios that not include for example solar activity surprise surprise the sun warms things government atmospheric scientist stanley goldenberg the hurricane research division noaa stated blatant lie put forth the media that makes seem that there only fringe ientists who not buy into anthropogenic global warming geoffrey duffy professor the department chemical and materials engineering the university auckland new zealand stated even doubling tripling the amount carbon dioxide will virtually have little impact water vapor and water condensed particles clouds dominate the worldwide scene and always will this has always happened have gone through these stages not want make this part without documentation but when went through one the other warming periods this country was back before they had the combustion engine back before was even around yet here are today with all these people the names are the top scientists the world who are making these statements lot them used the other side this issue that was back when they were being threatened with withdrawal various funding for the projects they had and now they are back the other side andrei kapitsa russian geographer and antarctic ice core researcher stated the kyoto theorists have put the cart before the horse global warming that triggers higher levels carbon dioxide the atmosphere not the other way around large number critical documents submitted the united nations conference madrid vanished without trace result the discussion was onesided and heavily biased and the declared global warming scientific fact prominent hungarian physicist and environmental researcher miklos zagoni reversed his view was the other side this issue manmade warming now skeptic zagoni once hungarys most outspoken supporter the kyoto protocol stated that natures regulatory instrument water vapor more carbon dioxide leads less moisture the air keeping the overall greenhouse gases content accord with the necessary balance conditions again that very prominent scientist perhaps considered the most prominent scientist hungary geologist david gee the chairman the science committee the international geological congress who has authored plus peerreviewed papers who currently uppsala university sweden stated for how many years must the planet cool before begin understand that the planet not warming for how many years must cooling meteorologist hajo smit holland who reversed his beliefhe was another one the other side this issue aother one the many scientists who reversed his belief manmade warming become skepticis former member the dutch ipcc committee stated gore prompted start delving into the science again and quickly found myself solidly the skeptic camp climate models can best useful for explaining climate changes after the fact south african nuclear physicist and chemical engineer philip lloyd was also one them who was very prominent the united nations ipcc years past was the cocoordinating lead author who has authored over refereed publications and stated the quality produce insignificant terms natural circulation between air water and soil doing detailed assessment the ipcc reports and the summaries for policymakers identifying the way which the summaries have distorted the science actually getting that report have said have been looking these reports for policymakers for long time and those people the other side would have you believe that the national academy sciences that the united nations not scientists this summary for policymakers these are politicians who have agenda atmospheric physicist james peden formerly the space research and coordination center pittsburgh stated many scientists are now searching for way back out quietly from promoting warming fears without having their professional careers ruined this the intimidation was talking about geophysicist phil chapman astronautical engineer and former nasa astronaut who served staff physicist mit stated all those urging action curb global warming need take off the blinkers and give some thought what should are facing global cooling instead which incidentally happens going right now environmental scientist professor delgado domingos portugal the founder the numerical weather forecast group who has more than published articlesthese guys are smart guys this not politicians talking these are the incontrovertible scientists who cannot challengedstated creating ideology pegged carbon dioxide dangerous nonsense the present alarm climate change instrument social control pretext for major business and political battle became ideology which concerning takeda kunihiko vice chancellor the institute science and technology research chubu university japan stated emissions make absolutely difference one way another every scientist knows this but doesnt pay say global warming political vehicle keeps europeans the drivers seat and developing nations walking barefoot awardwinning paleontologist eduardo tonni the committee for scientific research buenos aires and the head the paleontology department the university plata said the global warming scaremongering has its justifications the fact that something that generates funds there again all these different groups and these foundations who will fund people who will agree support their political positions atmospheric scientist art douglas former chair the atmospheric sciences department creighton university omaha and author numerous peerreviewed publications stated whatever the weather its not being caused global warming anything the climate may starting into cooling period and this the way something that nobody questions now are going well into cooling period chemist patrick frank who has authored more than peerreviewed articles stated but there falsifiable scientific basis whatever assert this warming caused humanproduced greenhouse gasses because current physical theory too grossly inadequate establish any cause all awardwinning nasa astronaut and moonwalker jack schmitt who flew the apollo mission and formerly the norwegian geological survey and for the geological survey stated the global warming scare being used political tool increase government control over american lives incomes and decisionmaking has place the societys activities the way would have add that another one the motivations the united nations they are always critical when threaten withhold some the funding when they are advocating policies that are contrary our policies the united states they would love nothing more than have some type funding mechanism where they did not have accountable the united states any other nation climatologist richard keen the department atmospheric and oceanic sciences the university colorado stated earth has cooled since defiance the predictions the ipcc the global temperature for was the coldest decade and the coldest the millennium which why global warming now called climate change this kind interesting next week going put together what has been happening recently this cooling period the fact that have had records that are set all around the united states and all around the world and that exactly what richard keen talking about now are cooling period has drive these global warming people nuts have recognize that leblanc smith retired principal research scientist with australias csiro stated have yet see credible proof carbon dioxide driving climate change let alone manmade driving the atmosphere hotspot missing and the ice core data refute this when will collectively awake from this deceptive delusion that leblanc smith australia one the top scientists australia the distinguished scientists featured this new report are experts diverse fields including climatology geology biology glaciology biogeography meteorology oceanography economics chemistry mathematics environmental sciences astrophysics engineering physics and paleoclimatology some those profiled have won nobel prizes for their outstanding contribution their field expertise and many shared portion the ipcc nobel peace price with gore the notion hundreds thousands scientists agreeing scientific statement does not hold scrutinyjust not true recent research australian climate data analyst john mclean revealed that the ipccs peerreview process for the summary for policymakers leaves much desired the scientists who participated the ipcc summary for policymakers had adhere the wishes the united nations political leaders and delegates process described more closely resembling political partys convention platform battle not scientific process only scientists wrote the mediahyped summary for policymakers and was actually published the politicians and not the scientists one former ipcc scientist bluntly told epw our committee how the united nations ipcc summary for policymakers distorted the scientists work said have found examples summary say ing precisely the opposite what the scientists said this was from south african nuclear physicist and chemical engineer philip lloyd ipcc cocoordinating lead author who has authored over referred publications international report the found its climate agency rife with bad practices others like note that the national academy sciences and the american meteorological society have issued statements endorsing the socalled consensus view that man driving global warming but both the nas and the ams never allowed member scientists directly vote these climate statements essentially only two dozen members the governing bodies these institutions produced consensus statement this report gives voice the rankandfile scientists who were shut out the process they are very thankful many these scientists are glad that have this report that they now have access the truth and they can come out from hiding the more than scientists expressing skepticism comes after the ipcc chairman pachauri implied that there were only about dozen skeptical scientists left the world former vice president gore has claimed that scientists skeptical climate change are akin flat earth society members and similar number those who believe that the moon landing was actually staged movie lot arizona shame that proponents have now been reduced name calling that what are getting now name calling and insults when you lose your logic this what happens they start the name calling and insults because they dont have logic examples consensus claims madq promoters manmade climate fears the special climate envoy gro harmel brundtland may declared that the debate over and added that its completely immoral even question the scientific consensus the framework convention climate change executive secretary said was criminally irresponsible ignore the urgency global warming this was november abc news global warming reporter bill blakemore reported august after extensive searches abc news has found such scientific debate global warming while the dissentinj scientists contained the report hold diverse range views they generally rally around four key points the earth currently well within national climate variability are talking about the top scientists the world almost all climate fear generated unproven computer model predictions abundance peerreviewed studies continues debunk rising fears consensus has been manufactured for political and not scientific purposes those four things all these top scientists the world agree since released the report december other scientists have contacted included december more scientists were added including meteorologists from germany the netherlands and cnn even cnn very much the other side this issue two more their meteorologists have come over and become skeptics well professors from mit the university arizona and other institutions one prominent scientist added was awardwinning princeton university physicist will happer who was reportedly fired former vice president gore for failing adhere gores scientific views happer has now declared manmade global warming fears mistaken happer professor the department physics princeton university and former director energy research the department energy who has published over scientific papers and fellow the american physical society the american association for the advancement scientists and the national academy sciences happer does not mince words when comes warming fears said convinced that the current alarm over carbon dioxide mistaken fears about manmade global warming are unwarranted and are not based good science face new administration and eager draw the into its climate policy lets not forget that this aspect the debate still alive and well and only growing should not become weary calling into question policy choices when they are driven still evolving scientific assessment especially when the stakes are high and the costs are extraordinary let hope this administration and our news media recognize this new reality move forward into this new congress personal note has been lonely fight for the last years have been talking about the hollywood and mediadriven fear that tries convince that those who are fueling this machine called america are somehow evil and fully responsible for global warming this absurd all know better does take power run this machine call america the past the only argument that defeated all the capandtrade schemes was the economic argument think you can argue each one differently saying this wouldnt cost the same adhering emissions required kyoto back the kyoto treaty days but any time you get into cap and trade going cost about billion annually taxes was critical colleagues the senators who voted give unelected bureaucrat secretary paulson billion with wished with oversight was critical that course that oneshot deal this was every year billion annual tax increase was too much even the science was fully settled now the science shifting dramatically the other side believe need looking even use their own figures trillion the cost the life similar bill the liebermanwarner bill conclude repeating something have said many times even you believe this you

president yesterday joined senator lincoln introduce legislation make permanent the tremendous change congress enacted last october enhance the refundable child tax credit assist working families congress reduced the amount earnings family must have qualify for the refundable child tax credit for from the that prevailed prior passage the act unfortunately because congress did not make the incentive permanent families will have earn least morethis year take advantage the incentive time which the economy recession and many have work two even three jobs put food the table would unconscionable make families toil even harder provide their children with lifes necessities that why proud introduce the working family child assistance act permanently set the amount earnings necessary qualify for the refundable child tax credit last octobers change boost the refundable child tax credit took significant time materialize and although the road was long was worthwhile journey indeed our work began when pushed make the child tax credit refundable for workers making around the minimum wage enacted portion taxpayers child tax credit would refundableup percent earnings above not resting our victory congress passed the working families tax relief act which increased from percent percent the portion the child tax credit that refundable although the legislation increased the amount the refundable child credit failed increase the number families eligible for the benefit the reason was that did not reduce the amount earnings family must have qualify for the incentive worse still the earnings threshold rose each year because was adjusted for inflation the consequences were serious for lowincome americans living paychecktopaycheck because meant that tens thousands lowincome families were left completely ineligible for credit they should receive ensure that lowincome families could get the benefits that they rightly deserve worked with colleagues introduce legislation both and reduce the earnings threshold for the refundable child tax credit and deindex that amount for inflation mentioned were more successful than that last year when congress lowered the earnings threshold for unfortunately cannot rest our laurels and must get right back work this year because the incentive passed last october was effective for just only taxpayers earning over are eligible receive the refundable portion the child tax credit lowincome families earning less than that amount are shut out the child tax credit completely example how crucial enact our legislation permanently set the threshold for the refundable credit lets look the following example single mother who earns the current minimum wage per hour and works hour week for all weeks the year would earn accordingly under the law effective for her refundable child tax credit would contrast the earnings threshold were set her refundable child tax credit would jump thus congress does not change the law that mother will have fewer dollars her pocket this year than she did last year put another way she wont have the money that necessary for her clothe her child and put gas the car what even more regrettable that the amount will only grow next year because the she needed earn this year adjusted for inflation and will increase lets the right thing and make permanent the sensible change congress made last year set the earnings threshold for the refundable child tax credit our families and our country are better off when governnent lets people keep more what they earn particularly the most vulnerable among parents deserve their perchild tax credit and this bill rewards families for work conclusion would note that presidentelect obama was stalwart supporter our efforts member the senate and hope that will work with congress can help additional million children whose parents and guardians struggle every day take care them

president today reintroduce piece initiative named because collection proposals that address issues important the economy education employment and energy this piece the legislation focuses the important supporting role that transportation can play economic development creating environment where employers and those seeking employment better employment are connected together having such system overcome transportation hurdles can benefit both employers and employees well the local economy and all the more important these difficult economic times more general terms investing our infrastructure like roads bridges and transit systems can have direct job creation impacts this one reason have fought hard with the rest the delegation for fair rate return for wisconsin from the highway bill also why letter sent presidentelect obama and senate leaders included highway and transit projects part variety readytogo infrastructure projects that should included the forthcoming economic recovery program addition supporting transportationrelated jobs linking workers and businesses that need them can also important part more comprehensive job creation strategy this can mean supporting robust public transportation system more specific programs designed link lowincome individuals with jobs have consistently done the former supporting public transportation during consideration the highway bill and amtrak reauthorizations but specific propqsal today focuses the latter and improving the job access and reverse commute jarc program that links lowincome workers with employers have heard good things about the jarc program and was glad that was shifted away from earmarks and was made available combination formula and competitively awarded program the last highway bill the primary program goal locally assess the transportation needs lowincome workers and then plan and fund programs help alleviate transportationrelated barriers employment better employment while initially this may have been viewed way support reverse commute projects whereby transit routes were established allow city center residents access jobs the suburbs the program actually does much more than just this and provides reliable transportation lowincome urban rural and suburban workers wisconsin the federal jarc program jointly administered the state departments transportation and workforce development the wisconsin employment transportation assistance program wetap according the wisconsin department transportation transportation barriers can include lack dependable vehicle bus service the area absence local jobs childcare transportation problems the state agencies wisconsin have found several different types projects effective depending the local circumstances these projects have included the traditional public transit projects such extending bus lines supporting vanpooling along with other programs such providing cars car repairs lowincome individuals wisconsin has even found that assisting with indirect barriers such transportation children and from childcare facilities critical allowing some individuals improve their job prospects recent university illinois chicago uic study found that the societal benefits from this program are per dollar spent and estimates lifetime benefits low income participants per dollar spent due their ability find and retain better paying jobs while the goals the job access and reverse commute program are important and the program has been found fairly effective there are some details that have prevented the program from reaching its full potential working closely with transportation officials wisconsin and partially based recommendations from the uic study ive come with some specific ideas improve the program with proven effective program and continuing unmet needs employers and lowincome individuals seeking employment jarc could use boost funding that why proposal ramps funding million over years from the current funding million million fiscal year proposal would also allow the federal share projects increase percent from the current percent level for operating expenses the percent local and state match wasnt feasible for far too many local governments wisconsin and result wisconsin has not been able spend all its federal funds the higher federal cost share will better balance the need leverage federal funds while ensuring that these critical funds are fully utilizedmillions dollars account does nothing link people jobs besides the challenge coming with percent local cost share the other main issue that has kept jaro from being effective could the paperwork and reporting burden required the program especially for the small nonprofit groups that often have never dealt with federal grant requirements before proposal directs the federal transit agency examine the current reporting requirements see there are ways streamline the amount paperwork required while still ensuring that the program goals are met bill also includes pilot program funded million year for years order test few areas that seem very promising but should evaluated more fully before broader implementation the first portion the pilot program builds off the regulatory streamlining evaluation and allows the fta test streamlined reporting requirements help get the balance between oversight and administrative burden right the second part the pilot program focuses improving education and employmentrelated transportation for teens and young adults enabling students and young people reliably get between their high schools neighborhoods and technical colleges job training centers apprenticeships can have lifelong positive impact the third section the pilot program would allow experimentation with combining different transit programs and integrating jarc projects across local political boundaries provide more comprehensive local transportation system instead having one transit program assist the disabled one targeted toward the elderly and another focused jobs this pilot program would encourage funding combined applications meet these needs together with one comprehensive project there even the potential for the department transportation ter further coordinate with other departments such health and human services for healthcarerelated transportation similarly the needs employers for employees not recognize local political boundaries encouraging greater collaboration between local entities make more robust interconnected system should ultimately provide more efficient and effective service while the fta already provides some technical assistance for the jarc program proposal provides small boost funding and some additional areas emphasis for example after hearing about the struggles that some small nonprofits have with the reporting requirements addition looking for ways streamline the requirements proposal would direct the fta also provide some technical assistance especially targeted this need the final element proposal the offset the new spending authorized the proposal fully offset rescinding highway and bridge earmarks that have not had funds spent from them despite being authorized over decade ago part the tea highway bill helping connect workers and employers much better use these funds than letting them sit unused some obscure dot account providing reliable transportation lowincome individuals only goes farit the companies and innovators creating the jobs and the individuals seeking better their lot through education more challenging employment that are doing the heavy lifting that being said transportation can clearly challenge for companies and workers and the case the jarc program can play important supporting role feingold

high dropout rate our nations high schools while numbers vary slightly growing body research indicates that the united states has graduation rate approximately percent and that about onethird our countrys high school students will not graduate time graduation rates for minority and lowincome students are even lower many cases alarmingly lower addition many our nations urban school districts

into future career and academic success this increasingly competitive twentyfirst century where postsecondary education now required for many entrylevel jobs show our nations students why important that they graduate from high school another issue that this bill seeks address the growing sense among employers and postsecondary institutions that our nations high school students who graduate are unprepared for success either the workforce college employers various economic sectors including technology manufacturing health care construction and others report difficulty identifying qualified candidates for skilled positions recent surveys also indicate that many employers are dissatisfied with the overall preparation secondary school graduates order for companies the united states

very pleased introduce the health information technology act with friend and colleague from maine senator snowe cochairs the senate health care quality improvement and information technology caucus have seen firsthand the transformative power information technology has the delivery health care our legislation substantial downpayment building our nations health information network and important step ifi reforming health care doing will reduce costs for our businesses improve the quality care for patients and ensure health providers have access the most accurate information and very excited that presidentelect obama identified health important part investing our nations economy the result using century technology century health care system higher costs increased errors and decreased quality care too often care duplicated the best and most appropriate care isnt given our health care professionals cant possibly provide the best care they dont have complete and accurate information about the patient sitting front them many studies have found that much billion spent each year health care that does not improve patient outcomes treatment that unnecessary inappropriate inefficient ineffective for example last years series health reform hbarings the senate finance committee heard testimony from elizabeth mcglynn the rand corporation that only receive percent recommended preventive care services percent recommended care for acute health problems and percent the care that doctors agree necessary for people with chronic conditions when seek medical treatment its long past time that fully utilize technology make health care accessible and affordable for every family and business however most our nations health care providers dont have access capital order purchase information technology and service updates too many providers especially our safetynet providers are having hard enough time just keeping with their daily costs much less invest something new march institute medicine study concluded that order improve quality there must national commitment building information infrastructure october government accountability office report found that the benefits electronic healthcare information system included improved quality care reduced costs associated with medication errors more accurate and complete medical documentation more accurate capture codes and charges and improved communication among providers enabling them respond more quickly patients needs providing the most appropriate care the most appropriate time safe secure way can reap huge savings january report the center for information technology leadership found that moving standardized health information exchange and interoperability would save nearly billion annually the united states the benefits adoption and use health care information technologies systems and services will widespread employers will realize cost savings clinicians will gain new electronic support tools and patient information help guide medical decisions and patients will benefit froma more efficient health care system and from safer health care system with fewer unnecessary treatments and more attention preventive care know that adoption health information technology can play critical role improving patient outcomes and the same time greatly reduce costs but cant happen without the federal government playing role the members the health information technology leadership panel concurred that without federal leadership neither their individual companies nor the industrial sector whole can achieve the breadth hit adoption that would required realize the needed transformation health care our country must have national commitment building information infrastructure and the federal government needs step the plate and provide muchneeded funds get the ball rolling without health are not going able accomplish other reforms necessary improve our health care system that why fighting for funding similar the legislation are introducing today will included the economic recovery act will soon debated the sooner get them into our hospitals physician offices nursing homes community health centers community mental health centers and other health care providers the sooner our patients providers and pocketbooks will see the rewards
president today join colleague senator stabenow michigan introduce the health information technology act improve the quality health care through the implementation information technology hospitals health centers and physician practices throughout the country our legislation will help address two critical issues the first the serious patient safety problem facing our nation indeed most americans were told today that lives were lost needlessly last yearand cure was availablethey would undoubtedly call for action yet the institute medicine iom has reported that medical errors inflict that terrible toll every year even though the technology our disposal dramatically reduce those deaths second major problem the escalating cost health care health spending now comprises over percent gnp trillion last yearand the price health plan has grown high that million americans today are either underinsured lack any coverage whatsoever that group expands unemployment rates increase and individuals and families lose health insurance tied employment recent urban institute study found that for each percentage point increase unemployment million americans are added the rolls the uninsured however simply expanding government subsidies entitlements alone not the answer because our current trajectory escalating costs will erode our ability maintain such supports clear that some fundamental changes must made health care combat rising health care costs bold changes and innovations are necessary address both medical errors and escalating costs one those changes must the application modern data technology most have been told one time another were waiting get the test results mailed were still waiting for your chart consider the savings realize when physician can locate information efficiently that tests dont have repeated and data isnt delayed patient obtains faster higher quality care when multiple practitioners can review diagnostic test results right their desktops the fact the health care industry one the last sectors where information flows slowly indeed often easier track the service history ones automobile than see your own health history age where millions americans share family pictures over the internet seconds isnt long past time that physician should able retrieve xray just easily today the technological tools are hand dramatically reduce medical errors and save lives many have heard about how drug interactions can avoided software systems which check patients prescriptions for hazards and there are many other applications which can also improve health for example reviewing and analyzing information health provider can help patient better manage chronic diseases such diabetes and heart disease reduce avoidable adverse outcomes the unfortunate reality that the cost new systems and lack standards have prevented from reaping the benefits new technologies while the current economic crisis has surely put focus addressing the inefficiencies and high costs health care have long shared determination modernize health information with colleagues joined with senator bob graham introduce the medication errors reduction act make grants available hospitals and nursingfacilities aid implementation health infrastructure senator stabenow and offered our bill create billion competitive grant program and tax incentives enable hospitals skilled nursing facilities community health centers and physicians invest health the presidentelect shares our recognition the critical role which information technology must play transforming health care his campaign acknowledged the critical need make technology implementation priority lack standards ensure interoperability has been factor slowing adoption many health care providers one must know that system purchased will compatible with others and that matter what may happen the future vendorthe investment one makes building electronic medical record wont wasted other words your system must able communicate with other systems and your investment building electronic medical records must preserved when patient moves their electronic chart should able move right along with them prevent disruption the continuity their carein other words must have interoperability yet standards alone are not sufficient there are fiscal hurdles implementing health today many providers are struggling adopt new technology and for those who serve beneficiaries medicare medicaid and schip can exceedingly difficult our physicians for example have seen recent medicare payment updates which have not even kept pace with inflationeven expect them make major investment health must also recognize there misalignment fiscal incentives for health the benefits patients are evidentin fewer delays better outcomes lives saved modern information technology reduces costs well but primarily those who pay for servicesnot for the healthcare providers who must bear the burden implementation indeed has been estimated that percent cost savings accrue those who pay for services should obvious then that the federal government would invest health both improve health outcomes and reduce its expenditures medicare medicaid and schip that precisely the type investment the health information technology act would achieve because look the many studies and reports health clear that annual cost savings can actually exceed the price implementation witli that kind return indisputable that the federal government must employ health see not only the savings lives but also better management our health care spending our legislation spurs adoption providing grants physicians hospitals long term care facilities and both federallyqualified health centers and community mental health centers these grants are targeted help provide the health resources providers need serve our federal beneficiaries fact the size allowable grant for each provider keyed the proportion the patient care which they deliver federal beneficiaries this will help providers deliver better care those medicare medicaid and schip while also see costs reduced those programs that simple common sense the legislation supports reasonable expenditures for variety costs required implement health care information technology these include such components computer hardware and software combination with installation and training addition for system suitable for support under this legislation require that must meet the hhs secretarys interoperability standards our new legislation even provides alternative those forprofit providers who not wish apply for grant under this bill such providers will able expense the cost qualified system will thus assure that every type provider has meaningful opportunity invest moving their health care practice into the new millennium with the development century health technology system will ensure that providers have the appropriate tools effectively provide the best quality health care reasonable cost the current congress struggles with matters related the ailing economy many americans are finding exceedingly difficult access health care which they find both expensive and inefficient while clear that health alone will not reduce all excessive costs address every inefficiency one must understand that the only way achieve either goal have access the type coordinated information that fully integrated health care system would provide fact the information will obtain through health essential achieve such goals improving quality and reforming provider payment this the foundation for our work health reform when the medicare and medicaid programs began could have only dreamed about computerized clinical information systems today have this technology our disposal and strongly believe that cannot afford delay implementation fact face challenges the financing these vital federal programs this exactly the sort initiative which will enable achieve the fundamental improvements make our health entitlements more fiscally secure hope colleagues will join support this legislation may soon adhieve the goals improving patient safety and reducing our escalating health care costs mikulski for herself

president today introducing four bills that will preserve and protect majestic public landscapes colorado and help provide needed water supplies communities and farmers colorados productive eastern plains these bills were introduced the last session congress where they each had hearings and one passed the house representatives hope that can work together move these bills this congress and see them signed into law ask unanimous consent that the text all four bills included the record and printed alongside these remarks the first bill the arkansas valley conduit act this bill will help protect the water supply for the arkansas river valleys communities and its productive agricultural lands advancing the construction the longplanned arkansas valley conduit the bill will restructure the costshare provisions the project and similar legislation introduced the last congress senators wayne allard and ken salazar and introduced yesterday the house representatives reps john salazar and betsy markey the arkansas valley conduit proposed mile water delivery system from the pueblo dam communities throughout the arkansas river valley was originally authorized part the fryingpanarkansas fryark project unfortunately the authorization did not include federallocal costshare provision necessary cover the estimated million construction costs and local communitiesespecially those southern coloradodo not have the resources shoulder all the costs the project has thus remained unfinished for over years the bill will provide for federallocal costshare for completion the project with revenues from socalled excesscapacity contracts for water storage other fryark project facilities being used fund the majority the local contribution this approach the result close collaboration between community stakeholders and the colorado congressional delegation and will ensure communities the arkansas river valley can finance their portion the project without incurring unbearable financial burdens moreover the bill will allow the bureau reclamation move forward with the construction the conduit the depressed economic status southeastern colorado made difficult financial undertaking for the region challenge that continues today this bill will help see this facility become reality and thereby help the farming and ranching communities the valley continue produce needed food and fiber for the state and nation the second bill introducing today the colorado northern front range mountain backdrop protection study act introduced similar bills the house representatives the and congresses previous congresses the bill passed the house and the senate energy and natural resources committee but did not receive final action the bill intended help local communities identify ways protect the front range mountain backdrop the northern denvermetro area and the region just west rocky flats the arapahoroosevelt national forest includes much the land this backdrop area but there are other lands involved well rising dramatically from the great plains the front range the rocky mountains provides scenic mountain backdrop many communities the denver metropolitan area and elsewhere colorado the portion the range within and adjacent the arapahoroosevelt national forest also includes diverse array wildlife habitats and provides many opportunities for outdoor recreation the openspace character this mountain backdrop important aesthetic and economic asset for adjoining communities making them attractive locations for homes and businesses but rapid population growth the northern front range area colorado increasing recreational use the arapahoroosevelt national forest and also increasing pressure for development other lands within and adjacent that national forest can see the effects rapid population growth throughout colorado and especially along the front range homes and shopping centers are sprawling through valleys and along highways that feed into the front range this development then spreads out along the ridges and mountaintops that make the backdrop are danger losing development many the qualities that have helped attract new residents colorado important better understand what steps might taken avoid lessen that riskand this bill designed help just that already local governments and other entities have provided important protection for portions this mountaitl backdrop especially the northern denvermetro area however some portions the backdrop this part colorado remain unprotected and are risk losing their openspace qualities this bill acknowledges the good work the local communities preserving open space along the backdrop and aims assist further efforts along the same lines the bill directs the forest service study the ownership patterns the lands comprising the front range mountain backdrop identify areas that are risk and recommend congress how these lands might protected and how the federal government could help local communities and residents achieve that goal importantly note that the bill does not interfere with the power local authorities regarding land use planning infringe private property rights instead will bring the land protection experience the forest service the table assist local efforts protect areas that comprise the backdrop the bill envisions that the extent the forest service should involved with federal lands will work collaboration with local communities the state and private parties strongly believe the national interest for the federal government assist local communities identify ways protect the mounatin backdrop this part colorado the backdrop beckoned settlers westward and presented imposing impediment their forward progress that suggested similar challenges ahead this first exposure the harshness and humbling majesty the rocky mountain west helped define region the pioneers independent spirit and respect for nature still lives with this day need work preserve protecting the mountain backdrop cultural and natural heritage for ourselves and generations come the third bill introducing todaythe national trails system willing seller actwill allow people who want sell land for inclusion certain units the national trails system current law prohibits people who own land associated with several units the trail system from selling those lands the federal government for inclusion those units this bill will allow such sales happen this legislation identical bills introduced previous congresses former republican colleagues from colorado representatives beauprez and mcinnis the trail system units covered the bill are the oregon national historic trail the mormon pioneer national historic trail the continental divide national scenic trail the lewis and clark national historic trail the iditarod national historic trail the north county national scenic trail the ice age national scenic trail the potomac heritage national scenic trail and the nez perce national historic trail our national trails are national treasure and should allow people who own land along these trails sell that land the federal government part our public lands legacy but important make clear that these land sales are from willing sellers which what this bill will this bill makes small but important adjustment current law and think deserves the support all members the senate the final bill introducing today the rocky mountain national park wilderness and indian peaks wilderness expansion act which will designate nearly acres rocky mountain national park wilderness introduced this bill the congress member the house representatives was cosponsored the senate colleague senator ken salazar and eventually the colorado congressional delegation over period months worked together develop this bipartisan legislation that will provide important protection and management direction for some truly remarkable country this public lands policy goal that goes back the and long overdue this bill consistent with the colorado congressional delegations efforts the last congress strike balance protecting the park and the water users who rely the grand river ditch this carefully negotiated language met the needs those users but questions have been raised about the particular way that liability and water use issues were addressed the delegation bill specifically there have been questions about how these provisions work the context the park resources protection act while confident that bill addresses these liability concerns appreciate the recent efforts senator salazar offer slightly different approach that provides path widelyshared goal that has broad support colorado the wilderness designation this bill for the park will cover some percent the park including longs peaks and other major mountains along the great continental divide glacial cirques and snow fields broad expanses alpine tundra and wet meadows oldgrowth forests and hundreds lakes and streams all untrammeled human structures passage indeed examples all the natural ecosystems that make the splendor the park are included the wilderness that will designated this bill the same time the wilderness boundaries have been drawn allow continued access for use existing roadways buildings and developed areas privately owned land and areas where additional facilities and roadwork will improve park management and visitor services addition specific provisions are included ensure that there will adverse effects continued use existing water facilities the lands designated wilderness will become part the national wilderness preservation system that was established the wilderness act and will managed accordance with that act and the provisions the bill the bills provisions amplify this specifying thatno new reclamation projects will allowed the wilderness area nothing the bill will create buffer zone around the wilderness and nonwilderness activities visible audible from within the wilderness will not prohibited the national park service can act control fire insects and diseases including use mechanical tools within the wilderness and nothing the bill will reduce restrict the current authority the national park service manage the parks lands and resources the bill similar measures previously introduced predecessor the house representatives representative david skaggs well other bills introduced before that and legislation introduced the and congresses however does include number adjustments and refinements that reflect discussion within the colorado delegation congress and with interested parties colorado like the congress the new bill includes wilderness designation more than acres the twin sisters area south estes park these lands were acquired the united states and made part the park after submission congress the original wilderness recommendation for the park the and were not included that recommendation they are lands wilderness character and their designation will not conflict with any current uses the west side the town grand lake and grand county requested that about acres inward from the park boundary around the town omitted from the wilderness designation order allow the park respond potential forest fire threats was the case previously this bill accommodates that request also like that previous measure the bill responds the request the town grand lake grand county and the headwaters trails alliance group composed local communities grand county that seeks establish opportunities for mountain biking and the international mountain bicycling association omit from wilderness designation area along the western park boundary running south along lake granby from the town the parks southern boundary this will allow the national park service retain the option authorizing construction possible future mountain bike route within this part the park similarly the bill expands the indian peaks wilderness area acres the area south the park and north lake granby the lands involved are currently managed part the arapaho national recreation area which accordingly reduced about acres did the previous bill this bill includes section that authorizes the national park service lease acre property the leiffer tract that was donated the national park service located outside the parks boundaries has two buildings including house that listed the national register historic places the park service would like have the option leasing but current law allows leasing only for property administered part the national park system and this property does not qualify the bill allows the park service lease the property were located inside contiguous the park also like previous measures the bill addresses the question possible impacts water rights something that can primary point contention congressional debates over designating wilderness areas reflects the legal jahuary reality that has long been recognized under the laws the united states and colorado including decision the colorado supreme court that rocky mountain national park already has extensive federal reserved water rights arising from the creation the national park itself and reflects the geographic reality that the park sits astride the continental divide meaning there higher land around from which streams flow into the park and thus there possibility any diversion water occurring upstream from the park recognition these legal and practical realities the bill includes finding that because the park already has these extensive reserved rights water there need for any additional reservation appropriation such right and explicit disclaimer that the bill effects any such reservation mentioned there are also provisions this bill that deal with the grand river ditch created before rocky mountain national park was established and partly located within the park the owners the ditch are currently working conclude agreement with the national park service with respect operation and maintenance the portion the ditch within the park and the bill provides that after conclusion this agreement the strict liability standard the park resources protection act which now applies any damage park resources will not apply long the ditch operated and maintained accordance with the agreement the owners the ditch remain liable for damage park resources caused negligence intentional acts and the bill specifies that will not limit otherwise affect the liability any individual entity for damages loss injury any park resource resulting from any cause event occurring before the bills enactment addition the bill specifies that its enactment will not restrict otherwise affect any activity relating the monitoring operation maintenance repair replacement use the ditch that was authorized approved the national park service the date the bills enactment the bill also provides that use water transported the ditch for main purpose main purposes other than irrigation will not terminate adversely affect the ditchs rightofway the matters dealt with this bill have long history the wilderness designations are based national park service recommendations presented congress president richard nixon that they have not been acted before this reflects the difficult history wilderness legislation one colorado statewide wilderness bill was enacted but took more than decade before the colorado delegation and the congress were finally able pass second statewide national forest wilderness bill since then action has been completed bills designating wilderness the spanish peaks area the san isabel national forest well the black canyon the gunnison national park the gunnison gorge the black ridge portion the colorado canyons national conservation area and the james peak area the arapahoroosevelt national forests now need continue making progress providing wilderness designations for other deserving lands colorado including lands that are managed the bureau land management and the time ripe for finally resolving the status the lands within rocky mountain national park that are dealt with this bill lands covered the bill are currently being managed protect their wilderness character formal wilderness designation will longer leave this question the discretion the park service but will make clear that within the designated areas there will never roads visitor facilities other manmade features that interfere with the spectacular natural beauty and wildness the mountains this especially important for park like rocky mountain which relatively small western standards nearby land development and alteration has accelerated recent years the pristine nature the parks backcountry becomes increasingly rare feature colorados landscape further the parks popularity demands definitive and permanent protection for wild areas against possible pressures for development within the park while only about one tenth the size yellowstone national park rocky mountain national park sees nearly the same number visitors each year the same time designating these carefully selected portions rocky mountain wilderness will make other areas now restricted under interim wilderness protection management available for overdue improvements park roads and visitor facilities summary the rocky mountain national park wilderness and indian peaks wilderness expansion act will protect some our nations finest wild lands will protect existing rights will not limit any existing opportunity for new water development bipartisan and will affirm the commitment all coloradans preserving the features that make our state such remarkable place live think deserves prompt enactment president ask unanimous

are crippling our economy you know think there some truth that although think that the people the entrepreneurs the free market system much better job than government doing anything but think the truth this statement that only government can break the vicious cycle yeah governments got get out want break the vicious cycle that were rewarding bad behavior weve got get out this and let the market take care itself but havent learned from that because you know you would think that with the dow going down every day even with all the money that were pumping would you know what this isnt

continues grow the national debt has increased trillion since the democrats took over congress just years ago trillion increase the presidentelect minutes november said shouldnt worry about the deficit next year even the year after speaker pelosi floor speech march said democrats have made commitment honor the value accountability including eliminating deficit spending steny hoyer speech the national press club september speaker said today democrats are fighting restore the fiscal discipline that has been sorely lacking since why because believb deficits and spiraling debt threaten our future prosperity and national security what has changed year little over year whats changed rahm emanuel the presidentelects chief staff the white house january floor speech youre looking for crisis solve look further than the presidents budget deficit the presidents reckless policies are damaging our nations future this the same chief staff the presidentelect that the presidentelect said shouldnt worry about the deficit next year even the year after bart gordon press release january said american families must live within their budgets and its time for congress the same mike ross floor speech december said deficits matter deficits reduce economic growth they burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities they increase our reliance foreign lenders who now own percent our debt thats right foreign lenders now own percent our debt would venture say good friend from arkansas would like work with him try find out what percentage foreign investors and lenders own our

appreciate the gentlemans yielding youve made some wonderful points but come back the statement you have quotes there from our presidentelect have great hope that will able instill more confidence and more calm help reassure the economy but the statement only government can break the vicious cycles that are crippling our economy more the same were promised change and even though republican and hes democrat was hoping would get the change and get away from the governments interfering everything should have done better job the federal government should have mqnitoring what was being done and spent but the fact you back the late the government just kept getting bigger and bigger the government kept getting involved more and more has continued expand and grow and you look fannie mae and freddie mac those are governmental creations and then when they got trouble fortunately that time had secretary the treasury that was concerned about and fought here the hill try get someone take notice and start better regulating fannie mae and freddie mac but the government was more interested continuing throw money the issue and not fix our job and have said this before provide for the common defense and then beyond that create level fair playing field make sure everybodys playing fair punish the cheaters and let free enterprise work and more and more and more are getting the government running things and now after the bailout september has grown even more have got the government buying interest banks buying interest automakers creating car czar for goodness sakes cant design good pen card for ourselves here all that easily much less car good grief but anyway only government can break the vicious cycles that are crippling our economy our government crippling our economy did september continues has for many years the trick allow the free enterprise and the entrepreneurship that inherent this society that has made the greatest nation believe the history the world and yet thats not change only government can break the vicious cycles
the gentleman brought good point about government and the fact that have interest now banks and have interest the car business even have car czar guess thats going tell them what kind cars will sell best but the question have and think the question that the american people have the government what brought this the community reinvestment act and look love the community reinvestment act some the design because believe downtown redevelopment think need into some these downtown areas especially places like detroit and other places redevelop that downtown these downtowns are beautiful some that community reinvestment act was good but the part that was put place president clinton that told these lending institutions look youre either going make many these loans people who cant afford them are going fine you and then the government are bailing out these people that not only took that but then made all these different loan programs with derivatives that nobody the free world with any type computer could figure out and here are the governments being involvedand thats why this statement right here concerns much when says only government can break the vicious cycles theres truth that but its kind different truth than what the presidentelect means can break the cycle weve got get out
the gentleman would yield
appreciate the gentlemans yielding need have the feuderal watchdog groups like the sec better job monitoring and seeking out the cheaters and the crooks and that should have happened with madoff should have happened with many things that have been going some the problems are right within government itself and the gentleman from georgia friend exactly right the government will break the vicious cycle getting out and becoming more policeman going after people that are cheating instead trying dictate everything killing this country move quickly towards socialism now brought this meeting previously back september that when the government buys interest banks buys interest stock brokerage firms car dealers whatever thats called socialism and the government becomes partner and eventually the government takes over the business thats how socialism works was told colleague here obviously these things are not socialism because the socialists are not favor the september bailout bill well after passed saw one the socialist leaders television saying yes you know initially werent for the bailout because didnt think money should paid wall street and all these other groups but now that its past realize the governments taking over the financial sector the insurance company all these things are great its the greatest day for socialism american history was socialism socialism have used the example before but learned great lesson exactly why socialism never works not only did not work for the new testament church and eventually apostle paul had issue order that you dont work you dont eat didnt work for the pilgrims they had too many people starve death the first year they went private property and flourished but the summer spent exchange student the soviet union allowed trip out collective farm and the fields looked bad and have worked lots farms and ranches and normally you get your work done early early before the sun gets its peak and all the farmers were sitting the shade and was obvious they hadnt worked far midmorning and spoke little russian back then and said you know trying nice could when you work out the field they laughed one them said make the same number rubles iam out there the field here the shade here the shade many people dont understand why socialism isnt good idea always fails the only way the soviet union made last for years they had have tyrannical government that killed people put people prison they didnt abide work our government country had flourished because the government was the policeman and not the dictator thats what have got get back appreciate the gentleman yielding

appreciate the gentleladys comments she made know number other individuals would like make some remarks let just brief the gentlelady actually made four excellent points one she made the point that with regard the idea whether government can the solution all the problems there rush judgment yes there was rush judgment with regard what did last year with the spending billion tarp today there sounds like there rush judgment what may going the spending that may doing the future now barney frank said the other day week ago said these were artificial deadlines that were being set whether are talking about tarp the auto situation now the spending going forward the sun still rose tomorrow quote barney frank the sun will still rise tomorrow with regard our economy well should not set artificial deadlines the gentlelady also made important comment when she said its the peoples money that are dealing with here have always remember that its the taxpayers dollars must careful how its spent also within that subset the comment the nature politics that will political decisions opposed market decisions that will direct the forces the dollars should allow market forces direct thirdly she made great point which was going make well oversight past and future oversight didnt have oversight the past doesnt sound like are going have heck lot oversight going forward even have little modicum oversight right now hearing two this billion trillion dollars that are about spend just with the housing situation impossible for the federal government manage all these dollars going forward likewise here going forward will impossible manage finally she made good point well and will close this market heal thyself what she said likewise here whether its the credit market the financial market the unemployment market can allow the private sector with the assist the government getting out the way for the market heal thyself those situations well the appropriate manner
let just make couple comments too about some the things that the lady from ohio said those people wonder they would interested know they took the billion that about each that would have paid and straightened out their mortgage they would appalled know that not only that the government had been serious about this and put that money and told those banks that made those loans whether the government made them make them what you need back and renegotiate those loans whether its for years years less percentage rate you are getting your money back thats what you need but its lot easier give the big cats and let them wipe the slate clean let them fix their balance sheet throw those people out sell for whatever they can and about their business thats wrong would like recognize friend from texas
well appreciate the gentleman conducting this hour course when you come late the game you are going repeating some the things that have been said but think that some these things bear repeating think the number one premise that the american people need listening have this debate about further actions that this government might take intervene these markets remind everybody whose money this now some people out there think that its the governments money and let the american people keep some others think that small businesses and hardworking families across america that are working hard and conducting business that money belongs them thats the premise that believe former small businessman like the gentleman well have been out the marketplace and know what market forces are what know that government always hindrance market forces and has very seldom been oil for commerce begin this are going talking about who trust there are those that voted the other day that said dont trust the american people distribute their money then there are those that voted that said you know what trust american small businesses and hardworking families with their own money and believe know the right prescription how stimulate the economy how spend money one the things that know that the more money you let small business large business keep the more money they are able reinvest their business and what happens when they reinvest their business they create jobs what american people want american people want the opportunity that this great country affords them and what greater opportunity than have good job and plowing billions and trillions now are talking trillions dollars into feelgood things isnt going stimulate this economy the gentleman knows which the reason introduced bill today fact that going allow the american people keep more their money its going allow small businesses and large businesses keep more their money because thats the cheapest capital that they can obtain are taking smaller bite out that they can buy start another factory buy another truck for their electrical contracting business whatever business they are and what happens when they buy another truck they have got have employees for that truck what does that that creates more jobs hope the american people are listening this very carefully because really there are lot fancy words being used here but the real word trust some dont trust the american people just want the american people know trust them

madam speaker with president inaugurate and troubled economy can overlook the sacrifice our troops afghanistan this conflict overshadowed iraq often called the forgotten war last month became the first member the house serve imminent danger area since now members this house have served all americas wars from the revolution through world war but the defense departments policy blocked reservist congressmen from serving korea vietnam desert storm kosovo iraq senator and colonel lindsay graham broke through this barrier years ago and became the first member this house also serve since world war while our country has moved from draftee military allvolunteer force think its still important for many americans possible share the burden our troops our military the strongest when pulls into its ranks americans from all races creeds and colors and especially all walks life important for members this house where the constitution places the power declare war also serve alongside our troops voted for the deployment troops iraq and afghanistan and was honored then one the first join them afghanistan naval reserve intelligence officer deployed southern afghanistan support natos international security assistance force isaf the headquarters regional command south served the command dutch major general mart kruif and the staff his american deputy for stabilization brigadier general john nicholson the army can report the house that the morale our troops afghanistan high americans that joined feel that this the right mission the right place just because this effort times harder than first thought remains the place where can best support the safety the american people our headquarters was located kandahar airfield known kaf located just few miles from tarnak farms where osama bin laden had trained many qaeda operatives few miles further down the road was the palace mullah omar the murderous former dictator the taliban face some real challenges afghanistan our mission has now stretched for years and can wear thin with the afghan people look senator barack obama becoming our commanderinchief its important that review what have accomplished afghanistan its differences from the iraq mission and what remains done first its important note that afghanistan not iraq and almost every comparison between the two leads people making errors with regard our policy afghanistan while both countries are predominantly muslim with over million people there where the similarities end iraq country that has always had strong central government afghanistan has always had certain amount lawlessness even during the soviet dictatorship iraq has oil industry and middle class afghanistan has neither iraq was mission carried out america and britain nearly alone with few allies helping afghanistan home nato mission where very large majority the troops come from outside america finally the insurgency iraq was sustained dictatorships syria and iran afghanistan the principal sustainment income the taliban now heroin generating billions profit our troops have accomplished great deal already afghanistan destroyed qaedas training bases and then deposed the taliban dictatorship that protected them organized elections and then protected new democratically elected government under hamid karzai these missions were small feat country that has proven the graveyard the soviet military and that has seen elections for three generations since the mission afghanistan has stalled the taliban has morphed into new and deadly force the tenets islam are generally antinarcotic the taliban first eradicated poppy and heroin production but now has changed its practice once the taliban longer had easy access bin laden saudi charity money they went into the heroin business big time today they are more accurately described the narcotaliban backed least million annual drug profits some afghanistans wealthiest warlords are taliban leaders who produce heroin support jihad and terror against the elected government afghanistan and the nations the west the narcotaliban are not evenly distributed across afghanistan they are concentrated the heroin heartland the helmand river valley and the nearby city kandahar there growing misperception that the war afghanistan fiercest near pakistans border while that may have been true last year the key fighting this year along the heroin river helmand southern afghanistan the afghan government and nato are fighting pitched battles the strategic rear nato where support and funding for the taliban are actually the greatest our effort there has been expensive both blood and treasure area the has lost over soldiers but the canadians have lost over and the british over cannot emphasize enough the dedication and professionalism and commitment our troops and especially our nato allies personally served with british royal marine commandos with canadian troops with dutch armor officers and enlisted with danish armor officers and enlisted and with romanian infantry along with our service men

president have learned this morning that the unemployment rate has gone percent percentages dont mean much household which one spouse comes home and says honey lost job have seen now more than million people lose their jobs the last months face very severe and deep financial crisis there question about that there has not been debate the senate about whether there problem this probably the first area agreement there big problem with this economy the question what about what can give people confidence that can pull this economy out the ditch and try provide for growth and opportunity and expansion once again interesting read the newspaper yesterday that the new york yankees offered pitcher million year pitch for the next years not all the economy deep trouble apparently there least one baseball team and one pitcher smiling today but even read those kinds stories many american families are worried about losing their jobs and their homes concerned about what the future holds wanted talk about that today all understand the economic engine america has stalled all understand the mechanics starting engine the engine the ship state stalled all for hooking jumper cables and trying start that the discussion had our caucus for hours yesterdayabout what kind emergency actions can jumpstart the economy what kind jumper cables hand crank whatever effort one wants make will help get the economy and running again the point made yesterday was that important and support but ought focus like laser are going spend money dont have put together emergency plan for some sort economic recovery that means are going borrow money are going borrow money time escalating substantial federal deficits want every single penny toward creating job that will put somebody back the payroll and give their family hope for the future this all about building confidence but even that ignore the fundamental requirement rewire this engine then have missed the boat rewiring mean this financial system has collapsed the biggest names finance have collapsed they have been the recipient hundreds billions dollars federal help have rewire the whole thing dont rewire that system and make basic fundamental reforms will not restore confidence the american people about the financial system going forward that means accountability looking back and accountability looking ahead means making certain end what have seen created recent yearsa house cards have the house top because this starts with unbelievable scandal the mortgage industry subprime lending and know read the papers about madoff having absconded with billion investor money building ponzi scheme the tongue and groove all the rest this fits and different than the ponzi scheme madoff was brokers mortgage bankers investment banks and hedge funds was collateralized debt was securitized instruments was exotic structured financial instruments created for one purpose give everybody lot money they all wallowed the creek the fact have fix everybody talking about jumpstarting economy putting people back work all favor doing that but want make certain rewire this system want talk little about what needs done let say also that people who created this wreck the people who steered this country into the ditch are not going the ones who show with ambulance they will not the ones will turn for advice how fix that just fact great worry have already authorized billion for the treasury departments troubled asset relief program isnt interesting that the title that program has nothing with what happening didnt vote for because didnt think those who requested had the foggiest idea what they were going with the request came from the secretary the treasury saying need billion emergency money and need days here threepage bill that made sense wanted relieve financial institutions troubled assets why did they have all these troubled assets because they were greedy and dumb buying things that now retrospect had very little value and very big risk ended with the biggest financial institutions the country having massive amounts assets their balance sheets that have lost value the treasury secretary said give billion taxpayer money can buy those bad assets and relieve those poor companies these failed assets the congress voted for billion billion which was made available right away the treasury secretary then decided really dont want that all dont want buy troubled assets despite the fact that the name the program what would like provide capital for big banking institutions they can expand lending because that the circulatory system our economy need expand lending rather substantial amount money was given the biggest financial institutions billion one tranche nine the big financial institutions was essentially nostringsattached money the money was provided those financial institutions without saying them the way you have use this expand lending order deal with the credit freeze there were restrictions that said you take this money you cant then give out executive bonuses fact now have report from december last year the troubled asset relief program the gao says the standard agreement between treasury and the participating institutions does not require that these institutions either track report how they plan use use this money isnt that unbelievable gave all this money the biggest banks and there requirement that they track report how they plan use use the money then when number them were asked what they did with the money the gao many executives those companies said well money fungible they dont intend track report what they did with that capital that unbelievable this apparently some sort noaccountability government there nothing aware course the constitution that decides this the way that representative government ought perform but when the treasury secretary came the congress along with the chairman the federal serve boardtalk about secrecy the way that another institution that has another story attached itbut they came the congressthe two them the head the fed and the treasury secretaryand here are the kinds things heard from them need oversight need protection need transparency want all want well the administration the treasury secretary works forafter told thathas failed this washington post report the administration has failed establish sufficient oversight over its billion program and must move rapidly guarantee that banks are complying with the limits conflict interest lavish executive compensation they say yes agree give the money there will oversight and discover well there oversight all the federal reserve board they are refusing identify the recipients almost trillion assistance backed emergency loans from american taxpayers they refuse identify the troubled assets they are accepting collateral the federal reserve opened window for the first time history noninsured banks they have all kinds programs now move money out understand there urgency here but not understand why the american taxpayers are told the way you are the guarantor lot these debts you are going pick the pieces and you are going pay for but are not going tell you what are doing president trillion emergency loans for troubled assets and they say you dont deserve know are not going tell you fact bloomberg the news organization had sue the federal government try get details about the total has gone out terms guarantees and capital which the way over trillion does not mean are going lose all that point why should news organization have sue the government order give the american people some information about how much they are the hook for with all this emergency activity about trillion what have discovered result bloomberg and the work some other enterprising reporters certainly not the work federal agency that has come the congress say the way here exactly what you need know fact just the opposite has happened the federal reserve program has about trillion now they have engaged understand that organization that prints money but also understand that organization the end stage organization created the congress and any liabilities existing there are liabilities the american people the fdic program trillion the treasury department trillion and federal housing billion that this point compilation about trillion liability that exists out there now want make couple points before try describe what has happened and what think should happen this has been consumerdriven economy not surprising brought the floor the congress one day whole stack letters that point had yearold son and the diners club had written son offering him credit card preapproved suggesting perhaps trip europe would line brought that and probably dozen two dozen other solicitations children from credit card companiesfrom mastercard and visa and diners club and american expressall them writing kids obviously they had idea whose kids they were how old they were they were just names some sort name bank they were writing them say here preapproved credit card for you have good time what has happened all across this country they are wallpapering college campuses with credit cards unbelievable most college campuses many kids dont have job they are going school yet credit card companies understand that the best place find customer there are credit cards all around wallpapering the entire country with credit card solicitations fact you have another card get rid bring will charge you zero interest for months dont tell you the way you have little problem one month are going jack your rate percent whatever they are doing these days rates and fees the fact that dramatic runup the last couple decades credit card debt has been unbelievable and that what has been supporting substantial amount the consumption addition about billion year has been supporting additional american consumption because the increase home values which course represents that huge bubble that was created home values that allowed people believe they had more money because their home was more valuable and they could borrow against the home and that contributed another billion the economy but was substantial amount consumer initiative coming from credit card debt and from home values that they could borrow against which turns out were illusory increases home values because those values have now collapsed point that our consumerdriven economy was driven some cases fumes that are not going around the future and are not going able replicate that build new economy with that same kind debt consumerdriven initiative you know about that point years ago the bubble began develop home values there was this issue thinking that everybody could make lot money developing new and exotic mortgages for homes and putting people into their homes who probably could not buy home finding people who were existing homes and saying them you are paying way too much what happened was huge industry developed this country even they were securitizing credit card debt and selling back upstream they began develop new industry finance homes and then found way securtize those home mortgages and sell those back upstream well this what began see this country everybody saw all you had was watch your television set and you saw the commercial come across this was countrywide which was the biggest bank you have less than perfect credit you have late mortgage payments have you been denied other lenders call the biggest mortgage company the country said are you bad person because you cant pay your bills are you bad credit risk you have lots trouble are you buying things you cant pay for hey tell you what have deal for you come will give you loan that countrywide the way this company failed and has been purchased someone else but the head this company mozilo vas given the horatio alger award one the best executives america and from what can tell appears have walked away with about million even though his company gone and does not have the job had certainly cannot weeping wiping his tears with million cold cash was not just countrywide millenia mortgageagain saw all these this was not some dark secret twelve months mortgage payment thats right will give you the money make your first payments your home just call days will pay for you our loan program could reduce your current monthly payment percent and allow you make payments for the first months just call pretty enticing right you want home you want mortgage you dont want make payment for year problem just call zoomcredit zoomcredit says intheir advertisement credit approval seconds away get the fast track zoomcredit the speed light zoomcredit will preapprove you car loan home loan credit card even your credit the tank zoomcredit like money the bank zoomcredit specializes credit repair and debt consolidation too bankruptcy slow credit cteditwho cares can you imagine company that says have new model are proud our company actually specialize giving credit people who dont deserve now does one wonderwhen companies such this sprang all over the countrywhy our economy wreck why have experienced this economy being driven into the ditch lot bad people three mortgage companiesand the way just case you are wondering over this from the internet lowdoc loans and nodoc loans what does that mean means you the internet you can still find company that says just the others did have new financial instrument for you that really intriguingno documentation your income that right will loan you money without you having document your income does that sound ignorant does but will charge you higher interest rate exchange for your deciding not document your income nodoe loans doc payments for the first months and the way when you first start making payments you dont have make any payments principal just interest that not good enough will give you nodec loan payments for months principal and you dont have pay all the interest because will wrap the principal and some the interest the back side does anybody wonder why had financial wreck had all these companies put out this sort ponzi scheme yes madoff apparently pretty awful guy because ran ponzi scheme billion appears this was all ponzi scheme well and everybody was involved these mortgage companies put people these mortgages called subprime mortgages and then the broker made lot money because the broker was able get people into these mortgages and did not mention they put prepayment penalties into the mortgages you could not pay off early you had big penalty then they wrapped into big security they put all them together like you put snowball together big securitythat called securitizationand then you sell you sell perhaps intermediary perhaps you sell wall street firm that takes look and says that pretty good that has high rate return because you have prepayment penalties and all these things and the interest rates were really low but they reset years really high what good deal going buy these securities everybody buying securities like hogs trough the brokers are making money the mortgage company making massive amounts money the people who are securitizing are making money the big investment banks are making money fact the current secretary the treasuryhis firm and four other firms came the securities and exchange commission one day and said what need you provide some relaxation for can take more debt buy more these kinds securitized instruments and make more money the basement deep the bowels the securities and exchange commission after hearing unanimous vote the sec for the company that was headed the current treasury secretary and four other the largest investment banks said will allow you take some this money you set aside the event failure your assets the reservesand you can take some those reserves and use them now make more money these investments that meant some those firms went from times leverage times leverage isnt that unbelievable they were all fat and happy making money left and right and then the whole thing crashed that financial scandal this subprime scandal took this country right the edge cliff was not just this but was led this and was especially this the same time all this carnival greed was going this countryat the same time were spending budget policypresident bush leading the charge and congress republicans and democrats part itspending fiscal policy way beyond our means billion year know the reported budget deficit was billion last year was not billion what your deficit really what you had borrow for the year that was over billion were billion out balance fiscal policy and that going over trillion this year then add that trade problem plus billion year consuming percent more than you produce every yearyear after year after yearand then energy prices roller coaster oil runs way barrel day trading just like that and then collapses right back down and now goes back because the circumstances the middle east between israel and the palestinians then health care busting everybodys budgetthe family budget the business budget the government budget all those together almost perfect storm the question what about all that because this economy mess very serious trouble and the one thing that unites and the smartest economist the most prescient business mind this country that neither have ever been here before are walking woods that have maps not know none know exactly how you are going move people out this situation how you move this country taught economics college ever briefly but know this this not about charts and bar graphs and not about supply demand curves all about confidence will see the restoration confidence because people are confident about the future they things that manifest that confidence they are confident about themselves and their jobs they buy suit they buy car buy home take trip they the things that expand americas economy they are not confident they exactly the opposite they defer the purchase they decide not take the trip not buy the car that the contractional side the business cycle but this much more than business cycle still confidence the root our opportunity put this country back track have great hope for this country but wish say this again have described some the unbelievable circumstances the carnival greed that has led into this economic trap and dont address both sides this issuefirst try jump start this engine ours and rewire the same timebut dofit the same time then make those this kind financial industry accountable for past actions and for future actions will not any way give the american people confidence about the future the question what you addition recovery package stimulus programwhich will speak about momentthe question what you addition that leads the discussion had with colleagues last evening said must revisit unbelievably bad decisions and judgments that have been made the last and years for example the financial modernization act was passed this congress financial modernization help create the large financial holding companies take away the glasssteagall actabolish the very act that was put together following the great depression that said you have separate banking interests from risk interests you have separate securities and you have separate real estate that was glasssteagall you have keep them separate this congress legislation called grammleachbliley after senator phil gramm from texas said you know what have something that modernizes our financial system have get rid glasssteagall have create big bank holding companies have allow that the case and have allow banks merge with real estate with insurance with securities now was one eight senators vote the floor the senate here what said this bill will judgment raise the likelihood future massive taxpayer bailouts regret was right will fuel consolidation and mergers the banking and financial services and will done the expense the american people said the same time that debate say people who own bankstalking about the folks who pushed thisand the way this was pushed because one large bank wanted merge with one large insurance company and they couldnt because the law wouldnt allow what the response will get the law changed wasnt just this congress was president clinton and his adviserssome whom the way are going work this new administration they said all this good are going modernize the system thought was nuts three years before this had written cover story for the washington monthly magazine talking about derivatives and what had previodsly described securities sold upstream the big mortgage companies and the title cover story believe was washington monthly magazine very risky business from that time have introduced five pieces legislation require the regulation derivatives and prohibit banks from trading derivatives their own proprietary accounts but avail because there were too many people who believed need modernize the systemmeaning they said take away the restrictions that were put place after the great depression take away the restrictions that prohibited banks from engaging with real estate and securities and other things that were risky well they succeeded failed stopping the fact what set this unbelievable spectacular financial collapse this country the question now what going introduce some legislation today and wish talk about specifically the requirements the legislation not willingas was not willing last fall the billion proposali not willing advance assistance proposals unless the american people are protected going introduce the taxpayer protection act that does four things that are tough certain and require accountability dont know whether there the support the stomach pass this kind legislation but will not advancing support for additional taxpayers money until and unless have some assurance that these things are done first all establishing financial market investigation and reform commission back the end the roaring twenties which the way the history books will certainly compare the era the roaring twenties with the gay nineties and the unbelievable excess and greedbut the end the twenties and early thirties the congress put together committee that investigated and subpoenaed and brought people here find out what happened who did how did happen and what stop from ever happening again that needs done again there ought select committee the congress doing that right now and hope will that some will say well have existing authorizing committees the congress that can that the fact they are not going they have never done and will not dont put together those kinds committees commissions here and now and issue subpoenas and discover what happened will not know how prevent from happening again need establish that reform commission investigate and then propose reforms that the rewiring portion what described second want all emergency economic assistance programs including the troubled asset relief programthe billion that didnt vote for but others didto have oversight accountability and transparency that needs required for all that there oversight for trillion emergency economic assistance this point that has been issued the federal reserve board oversight all none the same requirements the tarp program ought applied every other bailout the fed the treasury others providing similar help third should make conditions imposed one company receiving emergency economic aid applicable all companies and that limits executive compensation prohibiting bonuses and golden parachutes and payment dividends and private aircraft ownership and more should require thoke private entities receiving the emergency economic assistance subject audit provide detailed monthly reports tell what did you with that money that money advancing the economic interests this country put this country back track finally should create taxpayer protection prosecution task force investigate and prosecute financial fraud cases and other violations laws that contributed the collapse this countrys economy unbelievable that couple things conspired the same time one congress passes the financial modernization act which was complete disaster for this country two years later president bush came town and hired bunch folks who were supposed regulators who actually some cases boasted dont intend regulate want willfully blind that combination has injured this country very significant way our countrys financial marketsthe wall street journal said article arthur levitt october are their darkest hours years are this situation because adherence deregulatory approach our regulatory system failed know there are people serve with who think regulation fourletter word essential the free market must certain areas have proper regulatory authority alan greenspan who bears significant part this responsibility then chairman the fed here what says now made mistake presuming that the selfinterests organizationsspecifically banks and others were best capable protecting their own shareholders and their equity what was saying translate this english was saying believed selfregulation believed one regulating because they will selfregulate come from small town and small school graduated high school class nine that wouldnt pass laugh test second grade just let them all and they will what the countrys best interests that unbelievable have lot work the banking system after evolved that had lot banks that were considered too big fail but they werent big enough regulate apparently too big fail which means that they get trouble are the ones who are going pick the costs bear the burden will responsible but they are not big enough regulate they get the best all worlds they get taxpayer protection with requirements accountability this just few them let make aside even have described the floor the senate the past some the same firms that the way require bailouts are firms that have been irresponsible other areas yes upset about the way these mortgages were put out upset about the greed and the avarice and all the money people were making one guy making million year and his buddy making million year running one the biggest investment banks into the ground the way one the biggest bailouts has been one the biggest investment banks knowledge nobody lost their jobs nobody parked their airplanes wachovia bank wachovia bank went sour they had purchased but wasnt just because they were involved toxic assets wachovia bankit culture apparently here they had bought german sewer system you might ask the question why would american bank buy the sewer system german city because they like sewers because they have sewer department the bank because they have special knowledge sewers they bought german citys sewer system and leased right back the city because you are not going dig the sewer pipes german city right why would you want own german city because you can lease right back big scam because you can reduce your tax bill the government hundreds million dollars shouldnt pick wachovia because there are plenty others who did this happens convenient case big old bank buying sewer system german city they can avoid paying taxes the way the satne company got trouble with bad assets part the whole scam terms what happened with the scandal the subprime system that steered this country into the ditch now let say that this issue presidentelect obama proposing stimulus program economic recovery program very important issue for consider chairman one the subcommittees appropriations are working portion this effort find out what could invest what some call shovel ready jobs that will put people work immediately there are water programs highways bridges schools things can that will put people work and immediately put people back payrolls the end that expenditure you have better schools better roads better bridges and water projects that will enhance life those are the right things but all know there are plenty people who have proposals that have nothing with putting people back work very concerned about that also concerned about the tax side this are talking about percent this proposal representing the tax side think there are some things can the tax system encourage investment which encourages employment here are some ofthe proposals have made expensing for small business equipment encourage the decisions make buy build equipment right now that puts people work there are some things the tax side that think make some sense but worry about percent the tax cut side one going have problem saying yes give tax cut everybody likes that but the proposition the expenditure side whole lot folks are coming with projects that have nothing with creating jobs dont want part that money going borrowed any event need get this right willing participate and willing support the kinds investments that will put people back work and create asset for our countrybetter roads better bridges better schools water projects that need for the future willing all that puts people back work but ought looking with laser what that will put people payrolls try jumpstart the economy even that dont rewire this system and the financial reform described the legislation introducing today are not going succeed because the people will not confident about the future have fix what has helped cause this scandal and that includes fixing trade system where consume percent more per year than produce fixing trade system where have billion year trade deficit fixing fiscal policy budget situation that way out balance have all those things would not able come work the morning were not hopeful still have great hope for this country optimist yes want look back and hold people accountable want subpoenas and want prosecute wrongdoing want all those things with respect this financial scandal think big think whole lot folks took the million and they are home and they are wiping their tears with american

president ask unanimous consent speak morning business the time might consume not exceed hour
president let give some praise chairman one committees hit right the nose confidence what the american people need see have great resources this country and not talking materially the resource have that the most bountiful and most productive and strongest and made steel the american people when get together united nation there not anything cannot accomplish appreciate his words very much also appreciate some his wisdom and foresight heard today hopeful that the months and years come can continue work and can draw that american spirit which directly outlined which what makes unique and allows come from behind and accomplish the things front thank him for his words wish spend few minuteswe are going have several votes between now and next week over the bingaman lands bill thought ought spend some time today that since know wont want come early sunday wish talk about procedure for moment can understand are going here sunday not because have but because the majority leader has decided that will there are other things can accomplishing and goodness knows the problems front this country require extra effort our part are going have billion billion bill front again that will have amendments available and very limited discussion matter fact think the only one who has discussed anything this bill thus far and probably will not see lot discussion there are lot issues need address and colleague senator dorgan just outlined the most important them that confidence how reestablish confidence this country position that are not going reestablish confidence the country until reestablish confidence this institution since july the republicans have had one amendment allowed the floor the senate the last months one amendmentthat was september months legislation have had one amendment allowed the minority side express the views for greater than percent the american people the senate about anything about the ability debate and amend the interests the american people what have seen over the past months that the rights americans have been taken away terms discussion debate and amendment the very large issues that are front position this billwhich the american people should know hodgepodge ton bills not just all lands billsis about priority about reestablishing confidence about doing the most important things that are the highest priority for our country and not doing the things that are the lowest priority even though may make look extremely good back home some will contend this just authorization bill that doesnt spend any money whatsoever that will have appropriated remind them there mandatory spending this bill there actual spending involved alsoand wont this but prepared need toi will offer into the record the press releases everybody talking about all the money that going spent because this bill you cannot the senate floor saying this does not spend any money and the same time send press release out telling your constituency that you just passed bill that will spend money that will something because you are actually creating false expectation you dont expect appropriate the money lets clear about why cannot afford pass this bill has with whole lot things one cannot continue operate the senate where there are amendments for the minority because what does cuts off the voice over half the american public populations that are represented the minority but there are other greater reasons have trillion debt this point are going have trillion deficit next year that trillion minimum estimate cbo which does not include the billion will steal from social security and will not include half the money that coming stimulus package you take million americans and divide them trillion what you get per man woman and child that are going run the red next year real dollars real loss the future and are going have pay that back sometime the people this room the members the senate are not ever going attached the cost the price pay that back last year paid billion interest alone that about per man woman and child this country actuallythat are paying interest which going double over the next years not only are going run deficit are going run another interest costs that are going take away the potential families across this country who are struggling and that what are going put into their future when colleague talks about confidence what want the american people see working the real problems that are hand not problems that are not real are not priority offered several amendments were told were getting amendments this bill going spend some time going through those amendments because think lot them make sense also going spend the majority time talking about the main reason oppose this bill you will recall back the summer were paying for gasoline saw oil barrel which now around and the assumption this bill will ilever see high oil and gas prices again the very time fixing our future energy needs now not when there crisis again what this bill does essentially take trillion barrels oil this country and say you can never touch that
ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call rescinded
ask unanimous consent speak morning business for whatever time shall consume
president yesterday spent over hour the floor talking about report that put together that pretty incredible the numbers scientists coming forth now who were always the other side years ago were the other side this issue and that time were agreeing with former vice president gore saying that manmade gases anthropogenic gases and such were the major causes global warming now these scientists are coming over droves even individuals who are leading riots the streets throughout the world talking about having something are all going die spent more time than should have because deserved the time but had read lot the stuff know you sleep when you think about things like this and does get heavy lifting what trying say need view this with fresh look because many things have happened going difficult for many colleagues whom deeply respect who crawled way out the limb saying manmade gases and will have have expensive capandtrade solutions the problem they now are facing very liberal constituency that saying wait minute now have the white house the house and the senate have everybody lined this issue done deal fait accompli are now expecting you come forward this totally ignoring the fact that everything has changed from what was before last year had the liebermanwarner bill lets back further than that lets back the original kyoto treaty quite frankly way back years ago when became chairman the environment and public works committee all ever heard was that manmade gases were causing global warming and therefore have something about frankly when the kyoto treaty was first suggested was one who thought must true because that all heard the media when became chairman knew that would have impact the decisions that were made that would concern global warming thought that time was something should address then the wharton school economics came out with the wharton econometric survey this was something that was pretty well done and still out there fact have web site epw senate gov you access that you can see this more detail than you probably really want you are not believer the cost this issue then you would want that the wharton econometric survey asked what would cost the united states were ratify the kyoto treaty and live its emission requirements they came the conclusion that would the range between billion year always hesitate use figures such that because hard for people conceive how that affects them what normally take the number families america who file tax returns and then the division that billion year would cost comply with the treaty comes out almost fainily are talking about something that big this huge after looking that thought going cost that much lets sure the science real and there after looking found that the science was not there evpn though you had the appearance being there because the national academy sciences and the united nations all said the science was there the intergovernmental panel climate change something started the united nationsi hasten say have never been much fan the united nations start with maybe little bit biased this analysis when they put together the intergovernmental panel climate change they did for the purpose trying something force the whole world involved and say this world problem that will have correct this just suspicion have every once while the united nations comes out with something that totally contradicts our interests good friend from alabama and several put together resolutions these resolutions say will withhold percent our dues the united nations unless they reverse their position the united nations doesnt like that they would like not have answer anyone consequently they could ever get situation global taxation which what they have openly been promoting for many years they would position not accountable anyone this kind what happened this was the kyoto treaty fastforward then and when had two bills the first which was mccainlieberman those bills were also cap and trade cap and trade costs about the same amount money this very interesting you will hear lot people during the next few months say want some kind controls but are not going way that will cost lot money will have offsets the bottom line going cost about the same billion regardless what scheme adopt and how massage have say there has been awakening the last few years there were only two senators who came the floor and helped was the one chairman the environment and public works committee who was charged with fighting this issue was the floor the senate for days hours day that hours only had about hours other senators coming assist now fastforward that was the warnerlieberman bill had senators including the senator the chamber presently from alabama who came down assist this debate that huge difference resoundingly defeated that bill mostly the economic arguments not the scientific arguments when started the debate said dont believe the science there evidence showing that not there but lets assume for purposes this debate that the science there that manmade gases anthropogenic gases methane are all responsible for climate change and for increasing the temperature global warming lets assume that the debate started and talked about the economics the issue even assuming the science there defeated that huge margin fact barbara boxer was handling the democratic side they only had democrats committed for final passage that big change from now have something where everybody assuming that going pass because the democrats have control everything they have the white house the house and the senate remind them not get too arrogant because went through the same thing they went through the same thing and things turned out pretty well after that you look where the attitudes people are right now that are going passing something wouldnt get too far ahead what are trying and what did yesterdayand took far too long doing itwas talk about the size the tax and the fact that the tax going regressive one have say also that was one the few people who actively opposed the billion bailout again when relate that each family that files tax return about family that was giving unelected bureaucrat the sole control over billion one the things dont like about that not only was the wrong thing but that also got people changing their thinking these large numbers now that billion year that would cost had capandtrade policy doesnt seem nearly that big but would and would regressive the argument the other side you may right the regressive nature tax because everybody has buy energy everybody has buy gasoline and heat their homes larger percentage the expendable income someone who lower income going far greater than would have been otherwise but can take care that redistribution wealth toward lowincome consumers they have actually said that that sounds little bit unamerican keep mind are talking about redistributing wealth somebody has create wealth before can redistributed right nowand are looking the figures going around nowthere will not lot wealth redistribute get that point anyway that was the main argument was using yesterday and have used through the last years have had occasion give rather lengthy floor speeches the science global warming what did yesterday was use this report that put together the very top international scientists who refute all the arguments used heretofore would like concentrate for moment some the leftofcenter scientists environmentalists and activists are talking about the socalled consensus the huffington post leftleaning publication all understand that harold ambler was demanding apology from gore for promoting unfounded global warming fears the huffington post article accused gore selling the biggest whopper ever sold the public american history see former greenpeace member who was finland his name jarl ahlbeck says there has been little global warming since this interesting everyone talking about global warming are cooling spell now has been that way since the turn the century nobody argues that sure that upset lot people the promoters because kind hard talking about some very expensive scheme fight global warming when are going through global cooling nonetheless have all types people and cited long list them who say are the middle this cooling period right now going into the liberal side the leftleaning scientists one them martin hertzberg meteorologist with physical chemistry said scientist and lifelong liberal democrat find the constant regurgitation the anecdotal fear mongering claptrap about humancaused global warming disservice science you have some the punishment that has been covered this report they talk about how they longer can get grants from various organizations whether the heinz foundation others unless they along with their philosophy the other argument that has come that want use and make sure everybody understands even you are believer that manmade gases cause climate change global warming the things are looking now and the things looked after kyoto kyoto actually made more sense than some the bills have been talking about that happened and and because that would single out the united states and say this what are going regardless what they china and mexico and india and other countries obviously did and had this punitive tax arrangement that would drive our manufacturing base overseas places where they wouldnt have this heavy expense consequently would going countries such mexico and china where they have almost restrictions their emissions would have net increase the amount going into the atmosphere the manual have with over scientists would like suggest you that you compare that the ipcc reports the ipccthat the united nations intergovernmental panel climate changereport called summary for policymakers never saw the report just see the summary that was put together scientists who are pretty much owned the politicians who are wanting come these conclusions you canvas the scientists now canada who came out with report just recently canadian scientists percent them disagree that global warming science that settled the same time you have the same percentageand this came from the international geological congress which just had their meeting norwayan overwhelming number the scientists were skeptical twothirds the presenters and question askers were hostile and even dismissive the ipcc report the same twothirds keeps reappearing terms what the scientists are saying about this issue now yesterday did not get into this but you look those scientists who are the left side robert giegengack the former chair the department earth and environmental science the university pennsylvania actually was strong gore supporter the election now states that global warming does not even qualify the top environmental problems facing the world this not any other senator talking this one the far left leaning environmental scientists with alexander cockburn the same situation maverick journalist who leans left almost all top ics lambasted the alleged global warming consensus political web site called counterpunch org arguing that there evidence that humans are causing the rise global temperature this gets the intimidation factor said have been treated have committed intellectual blasphemy alexander cockburn stated this turn climate catastrophism tied into the decline the left and the decline the lefts optimistic vision altering the economic nature things through political program guess what saying these intellectuals any these scientists who were formerly the far left side who have come overas most them now have more than percent them haveare beat pretty badly the scientific community least the national academy scientists another leftleaning individual denis rancourt professor physics and environmental science researcher the university ottawa stated that the global warming campaign does disservice the environmental movement beating this drum big environmentalist when obviously the science not there doing great disservice and think that right then you get into the three like the best claude allegre socialist one the top french scientists the one who was marching the streets with gore years ago claude allegre recognized everyone has now totally reversed his position was the top guy france with david bellamy from the the same situation was the far left sideof this issue has come around have all the quotes these individuals there not enough time read them the same thing true with nir shaviv nir shaviv was scientist israel who now quite outspoken his opinion that the science just flat not there ecologist patrick moore was founder greenpeace and has now joined the ranks the dissenters said clear the contention that humaninduced emissions and rising levels the global atmosphere are the cause the present global warming trend hypothesis that has not yet been elevated the level proven theory this goes and and goes over many these areas think even some the mainstream media has begun take notice this issue article politico noted the other daythat paper are all familiar with the senatethat growing accumulation science challenging warming fears and added that the science behind global warming may still too shaky warrant capandtrade legislation canadas national post which always promoting cap and trade now saying the number climate change skeptics growing rapidly leave with three thoughts first all the left now abandoning the whole global warming fear concept and have all the names can recall when had our hour session with former vice president gore and never saw any sweat coming off his forehead until started talking about people such claude allegre david bellamy and nir shaviv who were always his side before second the cost you not want use billionayear tax increase figure use the figure that was used the boxerliebermanwarner bill last year was trillion the third thing keep mind has with kyoto would have been bad enough but for unilaterally would really very bad idea would suggest people web site have the web site epw senate gov minority epw stands for environment and public worksepw senate gov minority have lot documentation there for anyone who might interested the truth not that that always produces lot interest around here
briefly president see the senator from hawaii the chamber see has some remarks and would pleased yield him and would ask unanimous consent that recognized after has full opportunity make any remarks desires
president ask unanimous consent speak morning business
president thank colleague for giving this opportunity speak this time
president thank senator akaka for his comments about the senate and senator byrd and would share those certainly good leadin think the remarks and thoughts wish share right now the senate individual senators have traditionally had substantial powers participate the debate and offer amendments improve legislation the senate has been described the saucer which allows the hot coffee cool and think that good description have been very concerned that senator coburn oklahoma who has desired offer just one two amendments legislation that pending the senate before becomes automatically passed into law has systematically been denied that right and has been held someone who does not respect the body and doing something wrong think that very bad analysis the principled stands takes think one the finest members this senate has the odd belief that senator should actually read the legislation and can improved and should improved senator has obligation offer amendment fix that and has done however know senators have gotten into the habit believing that they have produced piece legislation and essentially piece legislation that lot people would agree ought passed without any debate and without certainly any amendmentsand the majority leader who have say going have watch this and going lead continued activity this areato deny the fundamental right senators debate and vote improve legislation cannot continue without causing very serious disruption the body because changes the historical nature participated bankruptcy bill was subcommittee passed the bankruptcy bill took several weeks was important piece legislation had votes asked for the democrats who were the minority they got those votes and eventually the bill passed with votes have forgotten which that what this body capable doing and should much more often let back what has happened here senator coburn has objected various pieces legislation they asked unanimous consent that the bill passed without amendment and basically without debate that what the request senator coburn has said well have amendment dont like section suchandsuch dont approve provisions this bill that will restrict further our already restricted ability produce oil and gas america for example dont want see that become law think that expenditure the bill unacceptable and ought eliminated cut substantially constituents think this not good policy for america and wish least able offer amendment well the powers that are not comfortable with that has been done during republican times but has gotten the highwater mark now where the leadership the senate systematically denies people the right vote was really taken aback that senator coburn has announced that not single amendment has been voted this senate since july how can that unthinkable that that has been the case but cant remember any know they were able ram through billion tarp financial bailout without amendment unthinkable think the history the integrity the traditional role the senate being eroded because leadership does not want votes they dont want their members have take tough votes that what you hear they want pass bills quicklylet you have little say and then pass the bill but nobody really gets try offer amendments make the bill better and anybody who insists that obstructing basically what has happened this body that now have public lands bill that has attached some what senator coburn has objected and they want move the bill without any amendments dont think that right let just say this about senator coburn medical doctor works extraordinarily hard highly intelligent has been successful businessman inventor and one the smartest members this body campaigned his state that was going read the legislation that comes before this senate and would work make better committed his people that would work control wasteful washington spending think almost every member the senate has said the same the only difference does with tenacity and courage and analytical ability that few possess willing come down here and ruffle feathers saying know senator you love this bill and you think perfect but have different view think this part ought fixed have amendment and want vote see colleagues agree with have gotten the habit denying this opportunity anybody thinks this such insignificant matterwhen passed last fall over objection the financial bailout the billion bailout think can say without fear contradiction was the greatest expenditure the history the republic allocation federal money the history the republic not one amendment was allowed blame president bush blame president bush but the democrats had the majority the senate didnt support would have been delighted stand with them object the breadth this bill the lack control that was xercised over billion taxpayers money but senator reid brought fashion that allowed amendments and they rammed right through the great senate the united states and committed this country billion expenditures and guarantees well how did work out most economists now tell that using that money buy stock banks private banks buy stock billionplusin big insurance company with taxpayers money has not helped the economy had the money been spent buying toxic assets promised might have worked least would have been further along the game why did that happen secretary paulson told wanted buy toxic assets told didnt want buy stock was asked about that the house committee said dont think should buy stock but one thing secretary paulson told the congressand was stunned reallyhe said publicly and repeatedly want maximum flexibility what think necessary fix this economy that what this senate gave him within week getting billion buy toxic mortgages try stabilize the housing market was spending the money buy stock banks and insurance companiesdirectly contrary what said all saying colleagues that the senate great body just commencing third term remember when first came here and attended luncheon and they asked say something briefly the words recall saying were that can think greater honor than represent the people alabama the greatest deliberative body the history the world that this senate but are eroding that tradition that heritage cant have amendments can longer called the great senate think senator byrd cant help but uneasy about these trends the senate has loved and served for long ought appreciative senator coburn from oklahoma for taking the time study this legislation offer amendments fix and make better and serve the classical manner smith goes washington serve the american people ought not create freight train designed run over him and silence and muzzle him and deny him the ability offer amendments that what are about there reason for having vote sunday except the majority leader has insisted and tried blame senator coburn are going stay session until sunday why are not voting why dont have some votes what are they afraid have vote serious what could fearful about casting votes isnt that what were sent here know every vote are going make somebody unhappy the senate since the founding the republic has found acceptable vote why are stopping voting now want counted his favor know the legislation before today has number good provisions support some them and some them have worked hard support and see they are the legislation dont think horrible piece legislation but just matter procedure ought not deny good senators the right offer amendments object that procedure believe will have confront this change the procedures the senate because are going wake and find not the same senate used know yield the floor
president wish speak few minutes support the motion proceed the omnibus public lands management act which introduced earlier this week collection over bills primarily they are bills that came out our committee energy and natural resources the question before whether the senate should proceed consider thebill strongly believe should and that the vote the majority leader has scheduled have sunday although itself new bill the individual pieces legislation contained and incorporated are not this package includes bills which were considered our committee during the previous congress several the bills the package have even been considered one more congresses prior the previous congress let make the obvious point that needs understood everyone paying attention this issue this not partisan bill the bills this package have been developed bipartisan basis last year developed this legislation hand hand with senator domenici who was that time the ranking member the energy committee this year have worked with senator murkowsk who taking over the ranking member the energy and natural resources committee develop this legislation almost all the bills that were reported from our committee were reported unanimous vote cases where there was not unanimous vote have made further modifications some those bills effort address remaining concerns collectively the legislation that before that are going vote whether proceed one the most sweeping conservation laws that has been considered the senate recent years will designate over million acres wilderness nine different states will establish three new units the national park system new national monument and three new national conservation areas will codify the save americas treasures and preserve america historic preservation programs addition will designate over miles new additions the national wild and scenic river system including several hundred miles wyoming that are dedicated our late friend and colleague craig thomas and will help protect million acres the wyoming range this large part due the leadership senator barrasso who the senate floor and intends speak following remarks the bill designates four new national scenic national historic trails enlarges the boundaries several existing units the national park system and establishes new national heritage areas establishes law the bureau land managements national landscape conservation system and the collection national monuments and conservation areas that are administered the blm the package not just about new designations the bill authorizes numerous land exchanges and conveyances help local communities throughout the west includes several provisions improve land management such the forest landscape restoration act which will facilitate collaborative landscapescale restoration help reduce fire risk and fire costs and provide new forest product jobs another example which home state new mexico the bill will reauthorize the rio puerco management committee this committee has become one the most effective collaborative land management efforts the southwest which for more than years has helped facilitate the restoration the highly degraded rio puerco watershed which major tributary leading into the rio grande this package incorporates separate bills that taken their entirety will have unprecedented positive impact helping address critical water resource needs both the local and national level authorizes range studies assist several communities conduct indepth reviews local water supplies and evaluate the best ways meet their future water challenges there are also approximately specific authorizations for local and regional projects that enhance water use efficiencies that address infrastructure that disrepair that provide sustainable supply water rural communities and conserve water promote environmental health and alleviate conflicts that arise under the endangered species act the overall understanding our critical water resources including the impact climate change our water resources also promoted provisions this legislation finally note that the bill will reduce the workload water lawyers the west ratifying three extremely important water settlements the states california nevada and new mexico these settlements involving indian tribes agricultural and municipal water users environmental interests and the applicable states themselves will resolve decades old litigation manner that consistent with federal responsibilities and with the broad support diverse interests each these situations most who are familiar with the history western water can attest near impossible task bring competing interests together agree longterm solutions that has been achieved this bill and this bill ensures that the federal government will full partner help implement reasonable solutions complex water issues think important note the lengthy public process associated with many the individual bills this package many these land and water bills began effort local citizens resolve important resource issues within their states many cases local working groups were formed and discussion took place over period years before local consensus developed following all that many these proposals then spent additional years under consideration congress often with further negotiations and modifications opinion this exactly the way the legislative process should work and this process reflects why there such strong local support for many these provisions based the action our committee last congress there also strong bipartisan support the senate for the bills this package commend the majority leader for his commitment pass this bill such timely manner and urge colleagues support the motion proceed and following that passage the legislation president yield the floor

madam speaker the resolution before the house today res israels bombardment the citizens gaza sanctions the incursion israeli troops into gaza clear this occupied territory hamas fighters regardless the human cost and calls for supporting the israelipalestinian peace process while innocent palestinian women and children are being killed gaza this resolution strongly and justifiably condemns hamas but the resolutions intent and substance are void any relation the hellish reality that being inflicted the citizens gaza right now the deprivation inflicted upon gaza families israels harsh denial food medicine and fuel over the past year this only the latest battle long war for respect and security between israel and the palestinian people israeli citizens have suffered for years under intermittent but terrifying rocket bombardments launched militants the gaza strip since israelis have been killed these rockets hundreds injured and the lives many thousands more disrupted the constant fear random and indiscriminate violence from the sky when this summers tenuous ceasefire broke down the rocket attacks increased precipitously prompting israels current military operation gaza recognize israels right protect its citizens from the persistent and growing threat rocket attacks however unwavering proponent peace and advocate for the rights and security the israeli and palestinian people seriously question the proportionality israels response and regretfully predict that israels military action will produce only shortterm security gains while severely undermining the prospects peace the months and years ahead despite the fact too many israeli citizens are under great stress from hamas rockets these weapons not represent existential threat israel rather than serious military challenge these rockets are like drug gang that uses drive shootings tactic terrify neighborhood when the solution this type terror for authorities lay waste the neighborhood recent weeks israeli air and ground assaults have resulted nearly deaths half these innocent civilians population million gazans already weakened previous months economic blockade are suffering from lack food water electricity and essential medicine with border crossings closed civilians are literally caught the crossfire between hamas militants and the israeli army with ability escape the difficult situation that existed gaza prior israels attack has quickly deteriorated into humanitarian disaster the world watching israels bombardment gaza continues escalate public opinion around the world hardening against israel desperate images destruction reach the media for example highranking vatican official has compared the conditions gaza big concentration camp israeli official condemned the comments and chastised the catholic leaders words far removed from truth and dignity but after days warfare reported officials gaza that more than people are dead which percent are women and children last night the united nations security council voted and approved resolution for immediate durable and fully respected ceasefire leading full withdrawal israeli forces from gaza the resolution also called for humanitarian aid pass into gaza and end trafficking weapons into the january occupied territory the united states represented secretary state rice did not join the other nations approving the measure our government abstained the bush administration has failed successfully work for immediate ceasefire and this resolution fails call for immediate ceasefire gaza what this resolution does allow israel continue its efforts eliminate the threat hamas which will only lead further civilian deaths with nearly gazans already dead and israels international image equally bloodied there victory left for either side achieve the present battle has become competition for biggest loser immediate ceasefire the only option the current fighting must end before the foundations the peace process are undermined any further and the prospects two state solution are dealt final blow the united states govemment must recapture its role honest broker the israelpalestinian conflict and urgently commit its full energy and resources achieving ceasefire and sustaining its engagement ensure the causes the present violencearms smuggling rocket fire economic blockadeare resolved the continued isolation gaza unacceptable option light the depravation and increasing desperation the mothers fathers and children gaza the humanitarian needs gaza are not quickly and comprehensively addressed the world faces the prospect radicalized generation palestinian youthover percent gazans are under the age america should lead international effort initiated immediately after declaration ceasefire heal and rebuild gaza the memory the present conflict cannot erased from the minds and hearts palestinian youth but can ensure those memories include generous and meaningful response from the world the goal the united states and the worid must work for peace and the path peace will never forged through violence for these reasons intention vote present res
madam speaker rise support res the gaza conflict resolution must end the current violence and bloodshed among both palestinians and israelis this resolution reaffirms our support for israel but additionally reaffirms our commitment toward continuing peace process with this resolution call for end the rocket and missile attacks from hamas and ask that they recognize previous cease fire agreements between israel and palestine response the attacks however israel sovereign nation does maintain the right defend its borders and citizens from aggression this basic right protect our people not one that should undermine our country knows too well that response must made when are attacked and our way life disrupted however there must humaniarlan considerations any conflict and there must steps taken protect civilians and prevent attacks innocent school children both countries result the attacks and subsequent response civilians are being killed injured and witnesses horrific tragedy humanitarian aid has only recently been allowed into palestine and there doubt that there terrible human suffering all sides hope that this resolution will help offer roadmap peaceful solution and that there will soon end the violence cannot forget that beneath the politics there great human tragedy will support this resolution but believe that must focus ending this continuing violence and search for peaceful solution for all parties involved

madam speaker one can view the reports innocent lives lost both sides the israeli border without sense mourning and strong desire see the violence stop some criticize the degree which israel has responded the most recent rocket attacks but inconceivable that any nation would tolerate rockets missiles being fired another nation nations not only have the right selfdefense but obligation protect their citizens recognizing this fundamental right the israeli government responded the hamas rocket fire the only manner available themby attacking the buildings that house hamas leaders and the sites where believed weapons have been stockpiled unfortunately addition killing militants civilians have also died result hamas exploitation hospitals schools and mosques store weaponry and conceal terrorist activities the loss civilian lives during any military engagement tragic but should not unnoticed that hamas selfishly relishes martyrdom the expense the innocent palestinians the actions hamas are unacceptable and must come stop immediately hamas initiated the attacks and now cynically cries foul when israel responds those who blame israel are playing into the hands the extremists who are opposed substantive peace wholeheartedly believe that must find solution that brings peace the region bear mind that reaching agreement the middle east has been goal among peaceloving nations since the founding israel the key point the conflict nonetheless has been the refusal number governments and militant organizations including hamas accept the fundamental premise that israel has the right exist without agreement this point peace will impossible achieve the onus hamas suspend its attacks israel and call for renewed ceasefire perhaps then serious negotiations can resume with the goal bringing peaceful coexistence the middle east one our closest allies should continue support israel their quest for peace and endeavor stop terrorism the region
madam speaker strongly support israels right defend itself against the hamas terrorist attacks until israeli citizens can live without fear these attacks israel justified its effort maintain national security for its citizens while all hope for peace this region must not come the expense israels sovereignty right exist the gaza strip from which israel unilaterally withdrew poses growing security threat israeli civilians over rocket and mortar shells have been fired from gaza since and this indiscriminate bombardment has escalated since hamas seized power their violent coup about israeli civilians more than percent israels population live daily fear hamas rocket attack hamas ended the month cease fire december increasing its random rocket bombardment israeli civilians israel was compelled take the responsibility defending its citizens against these terror tactics response being attacked launched defensive air attack against hamas terrorist rocket launchers and their terrorist infrastructure israel responded with ground assault minimize collateral losses the civilian neighborhoods the hamas terrorists hide launch these rockets critics israel demand sit down with hamas negotiate lasting peace ask them all how you find diplomatic solution with enemy that will not recognize your right exist what terms can you offer that will bring peace with such enemy other than outright capitdation madam speaker let stand together institution show our nations support for israels right defend itself against attacks from gaza and pledge our continued commitment israels right defend itself free independent and sovereign state
madam speaker when nations towns and villages are attacked without provocation nearly rockets over the span years there could hardly more solid case for the use force selfdefense least israelis percent that small nationare now within range missiles and rockets operated islamist terrorist group committed israels destruction have trouble justifying the war israel has undertaken deeply troubled however the suffering destruction and loss innocent life that war inevitably entails this case war forced upon israel terrorist enemy that not only targets israeli civilians but also bases itself among gazan palestinian homes schools mosques and hospitals order use innocent civilians human shields and tools propaganda war imperative that way found stop the killing both sidesbut manner that will ensure that this round will the last round know the united states and several other nations are working developing such plan our ally egypt should particularly commended for its serious efforts this regard what need not merely ceasefire but transformative ceasefire need ensure not just that hamas stops firing rockets into israel need make sure that stops receiving weapons and weapons parts and stops smuggling them into the gaza strip should support egyptian efforts prevent this illegal arms trade from crossing the sinai toward the gaza border ideally the legitimate palestinian authority under president mahmoud abbas should restored its role the effective authority gaza the aftermath any ceasefire the palestinian authority was illegally expelled from gaza hamas june and should restored its rightful role for hamas has prospect legitimization the international community unless renounces violence and disarms recognizes israel and accepts the validity all previous agreements between israel and the palestinians our resolution supports israels right defend itself against unprovoked terror and reaffirms this bodys unwavering commitment israels security and survival democratic jewish state condemns hamas for its year artillery war against israel and appropriately assigns hamas responsibility for thedestructive consequences the ongoing war gaza and insists that ceasefire established that durable and sustainable and that prevents hanas from acquiring more arms and provoking another round fighting commend the speaker and the bipartisan leadership for authoring this important resolution provides sensible way understanding how got the current situation and how should move forward that why support this resolution and urge colleagues likewise
madam speaker will vote present resolution while the intent this resolution speak out against terrorism and reiterate support for israels security deeply concemed that the message send may contrary the best interests both israel and the palestinians solution this crisis the middle east must diplomatic will not achieved military force the resolution contains many facts but omits others that are important the united nations office for the coordination humanitarian affairs reported january that since the israeli military operation cast lead began palestinians have been killed including women and children more than palestinians have been injured israeli media reported that israelis have been killed most them soldiers from friendly fire paramount concern today stop the loss life allow medical supplies and personnel enter gaza and provide emergency care those who have been injured the citizens gaza most whom are refugees have nowhere they are prevented from fleeing into israel egypt and are cornered one the most populated areas the world this resolution emphasizes israels right defend itself course has that right but also need stand strongly solidarity with both israelis and palestinians who want peace and end the horrific cycle violence that manifests itself horribly gaza today agree that the ultimate goal the united states sustainable resolution the israelipalestinian conflict that will ensure the welfare security and survival the state israel jewish and democratic state with secure borders and viable independent and democratic palestinian state living side side peace and security with the state israel unfortunately not believe this resolution moves closer this goal and because this vote present
madam speaker let take this means express support for res israel which has been our ally since president truman recognized this country could longer tolerate relentless attacks its citizens hamas and took military action prevent future attacks israel must defend itself would any nation the face such provocation the united states and the international community must work support enduring cease fire that ends missile attacks hamas prevents illegal arms and explosives from entering gaza and sets motion diplomatic solution that will alldw israelis and palestinians live peace only when the cycle violence this troubled region broken will israelis and palestinians able enjoy the peace and prosperity that people everywhere deserve
madam speaker will vote support res the gaza conflict resolution certainly everyone recognizes israels legitimate right defend itself the need for ceasefire and the demand that hamas stop its rocket attacks against israel recognize the right israel exist and join the rest the palestinian people negotiations with israel reach agreement twostate solution the middle east conflict and establish peace for all the peoples the region earlier this month issued statement outlining these same key concerns however would like clearly express frustration and dissatisfaction with what has not been included this resolution strongly believe the resolution should have included and expressed support for the concerns raised the international committee the red cross icrc and united nations field staff the ground inside gaza about potential violations international humanitarian law ihl both parties particularly concemed about potential violations ihl israel because such strong supporter israel also disappointed that the resolution did not reference the resolution passed the security council january calling for immediate ceasefire while the unsc resolution flawed its failure condemn haras rocket attacks important call for cessation hostilities which res also demands finally deeply saddened and disturbed the increasing toll israeli and gazan citizens this most recent escalation the conflict over gaza continues military operations must stop the rocket attacks must stop and all regional and international actors must engage hamas and israel agree durable and verifiable cessation hostilities
madam speaker the resolution before correctly condemns the actions hamas target innocent civilians southern israel and thwart the ceasefire that had been place for the previous months correctly calls for new sustainable ceasefire and affirms the commitment just and durable peace based twostate solution but the resolution does not begin justice the humanitarian disaster gripping gaza and offers little more than lip service behalf serious peace process focusing affixing blame for the current crisis fails emphasize the steps required lead toward longterm solution recently wrote article which appeared the january charlotte observer and miami herald which proposed immediate actions the must take return trajectory leading just and lasting peace ask permission that included the record after the conflict ends and the dust settles after all the recriminations and resentments have been aired will left with the crucial question whether and how resume efforts toward lasting peace this the only goal that can meet our and israels longterm security needs the region must act urgently knowing that the steps take now will determine just how steep that future road peace will

madam speaker rise express support for res the resolution places the blame for the situation gaza exactly where belongs squarely the shoulders hamas makes clear that israel has right defend itself and that the path peace the region lies the recognition israels right exist the dismantling hamas terrorist infrastructure and the release gilad shalit for the last eight years more than missiles have fallen israels civilian population centers killing injuring more than and traumatizing tens thousands hamas violates international law embedding its weapons civilian centers and using its people human shields its cynical choice reap public relations success from the bodies their own civilians reprehensible these are the irresponsible acts madmen and cowards not rulers who can hope lead nation hope that presidentelect obama will willing spend political capital calling upon the international community work together prevent hamas from rebuilding urge colleagues support this resolution and take strong stand against the morally bankrupt actions hamas
madam speaker israel strong ally our country and has right defend itself and have voted number timesalong vvith large majority colleagues the houseto make clear our support that right according one estimate many one million israelis live range rockets that have been fired from gaza militants one questions the responsibility right sovereign nation protect its people however the deaths innocent civilians wherever they may occur concerns join colleagues condemning all acts violence and hostilities against civilians and acts terrorism while hamas may indifferent the suffering ialestinians and israelis result its actions the rest the world must not share that indifference distressing see this volatile region again paralyzed new chapter seemingly endless cycle retributive violence which side really wins and innocent civilians lose the most must push break this destructive cycle the regional tors and the international community all need move quickly defuse this situation and help reach ceasefire all sides while addressing the security and humanitarian issues that cannot allowed continue fester the unfolding humanitarian crisis gaza and the firing rockets into israel not serve the best interest anyone truly concemed with securing permanent peace the region that why even more important that this house take resolution that makes serious call for and helps strongly support ongoing diplomatic efforts bring end the violence demands greater leadership and engagement those efforts and recognizes the great loss suffered the israeli and palestinian people result the violence and urges swift end that violence unfortunately the bill before today not such resolution hamas own actions time and time again show that threat regional and international peace this not dispute the house has rightly condemned hamas time and time again including passage last march res which supported however have several concerns about other aspects the resolution before today time increasing intemational concern about the situation gaza highlighted diplomatic efforts under way the the and the arab leagueparticularly proposal put forth egypt and franceand the passage just last night the security council resolution calling for immediate ceasefire fear that his may the wrong time for resolution that does little support efforts halt the conflict the security council resolution called urgently for immediate durable and fully respected ceasefire leading the full withdrawal israeli forces from gaza disappointed that the resolution before the house today does not support the uns call for immediate and verifiable ceasefire both sides when clear international consensus and diplomatic efforts are beginning coalesce and work towards solution why would the congress want consider resolution that takes sharply different tack the resolution before also differs number ways even from similar resolution that the senate passed just yesterday that senate resolution takes much more serious approach and puts greater and much needed emphasis the proactive role the needs play bring this latest crisis close the has vast array diplomatic and other tools that are the disposal the president and his foreign policy advisers help resolve international crises such this now the time open that toolbox and actively use those tools anything has been clear from the last eight years that when does not lead and stay engaged regional diplomacy the situation the region will not get better the the the arab league all recognize that israels military operations must supplemented and supplanted diplomatic resolution that will last that why the egyptians and the french are expending considerable efforts the absence leadershipto forge ceasefire agreement that meets israels needs namely ending the firing rockets into israel and preventing hamas from rearming while also addressing the humanitarian needs gazans just yesterday secretary rice expressed verbal support for this initiative stating that these efforts should not just applauded but must supported the international community but the resolution fails even bring the resolution before the house today also expresses support for diminishing the appeal and influence extremists the palestinian territories and strengthen moderate palestinians who are committed secure and lasting peace however this resolution its lack call for engagement and lack recognition the suffering civilians actually undermines this goakone that have long advocated and supportedboth its tone and substance the resolution ignores fails apprehend the tremendous damage that being done the efforts moderateseither presently the futureby the ongoing conflict that according one report has generated incredible bitterness and anger the region expect our moderate friends the middle east succeed such environment foolhardy best ceasefire does not diminish hinder israels right defend itself does help get back the path finding political and diplomatic solution that will address israels security needs and lead longterm security and peace ceasefire not end itself but desirable means halt violence and chaos the immediate term while creating room assure humanitarian aid and for renewed and sustained multilateral negotiations for sustainable peace congress must speak out help stop this latest crisis the middle east but way that our message fair tough and smart and that makes clear that the while supporting israels right selfdefense can and honest broker the region fear that this resolution fails meet that standard the best support thatwe can give our close friend and ally israel being impartial and honest broker that can work with all interested parties the region israelis and palestinians alike wary about continuing take actions that hinder the ability for the seen such mediator and which may throw more obstacles the way the incoming administration foreign policy aims the ongoing military operations israel cannot and should not substitute for credible longterm diplomatic solution reached with the help the international agreement between the israelis and palestinians that meets the needs and aspirations both sides that will prevent the return endless cycle violence that guarantees that security and peace remains elusive innocent people both sides want nothing more than live normal lives with peace and dignity while cannot support this resolution its current form strongly encourage the administration and the international community undertake robust diplomacy mediate crossborder ceasefire and continue engage constructive activities statements and resolutions will help bring peace the region and address israels real security needs
madam speaker have long record supporting israel and have intention reversing course wish continues that israel will one day soon enjoy lasting peace with its neighbors the resolution before the house today not easy vote for refuse vote nay because continue support israels right exist and defend itself but cannot vote yea because the midst humanitarian nightmare gaza this resolution silent the need for immediate ceasefire and the need actively relieve human suffering the resolution right condemn the rocket attacks against southern israel these attacks are crimes against humanity the hamas rockets endanger thousands lives terrorize the israeli populace and deny the people israel and gaza the peace they both deserve however introduce resolution the midst raging war that has the impression assigning blame does not measure the moment were watching another desperate episode the cycle middle east violence yet our call for ceasefire timid were watching human suffering stomachtuming scale and our call relieve suffering weak spasm violence consuming lives and were failing all that can honest brokers peace agree with almost all the language this resolution cannot vote against however cannot vote favor the resolution because does not enough set the stage for lasting peace conscience dictates vote present which the only vote for peace

thank the gentleman from new jersey thank chairman miller from california thank friend mckeon well for the consideration this debate weve passed this bill before properly unfortunately didnt pass the senate wasnt signed the president that will not happen this time will pass this bill belief the senate will pass this bill and the president the united states will sign why because its the right thing listened friend his conversation but frankly somewhat belies the fact that there came case the supreme court and the supreme court had rule the case and the supreme court ruled the statute limitation the value work course madam speaker lies job well done not the gender the worker dont think there man woman this chamber who would disagree but all too often america sexism frankly cheats women out equal pay and equal worth still robs women their equal right earn livelihood provide for their families and secure the dignity their labor does much its worst work the dark frankly women this body all know that they make the same thing the men this body why because its public information but were secret information notwithstanding the fact that had number women vote against this the last time was would shocked that they would again they were put the position making less than those who are males doing exactly the same job that the position course lilly ledbetter found herself many know now that lilly ledbetter was precluded from recovery for almost two decades from she was hardworking tire plant supervisor for much her career she suffered from two kinds discrimination simultaneouslyfrom sexual harassment when manager said her face that women didnt belong factory the supervisor who tried coerce her into sexual encounter there was pay discrimination well theres doubt about that now she couldnt recover for because the supreme court said she hadnt acted the end her career she was making nearly less than the lowest paid man the same position both kinds discrimination were founded the belief that women the workplace are secondclass citizens hope there are women america who believe that and would hope there are men america who believe that say that father three women the grandfather two granddaughters and the great grandfather yearold young woman the two the unfair pay may have been the most damaging between the sexual discrimination and the pay discrimination the sexual discrimination obviously abhorrent but the pay discrimination diminished lilly ledbetters opportunities our country there has been lot said this floor about its their money and they know how spend better and weve talked about that terms tax bills its their money and they know how spend better thats the case then would hope that this bill would pass unanimously make sure that their money which they earn fairly paid them they then can use they see fit ledbetter might have been the dark this day they may have kept secret because people particularly the private sector dont around saying well make and you make fact lot employers tell their employees dont tell people what you make lilly ledbetter didnt know howbadly she was being discriminated against coworker however gave her proof what her employer was doing her such silent discrimination surprisingly common because difficult identify after all how many know what the salaries our coworkers are said friend from california knows that she makes the same thing miller makes and thats appropriate they are both elected they both have the same job they both work hard and theyre paid the same lilly ledbetter took her employer court but the supreme court finally ruled against her apparently there problem somewhere not because she was making all but because she had failed file suit days after her first unfair paycheck now that adopts the premise that the subsequent paychecks somehow were not violation the law they were every time she was paid discriminatorily was another violation the law fact the days should have run from the last violation the law which course was the last time she was paid discriminatory fashion you have months find out youre being paid unfairly youre out luck for lifetime the supreme courts flawed ruling ignored the realworld facts discrimination and has the potential harm thousands women indeed hundreds thousands and millions women and their children and their families and our communities and society leaving victims pay discrimination without any recourse justice ginsburg saidand she put strong dissent pay disparities often occur small increments cause suspect that discrimination work develops only over time comparative pay information moreover often hidden from the employees view small initial discrepancies may not seen meet the federal case particularly when the employee trying succeed nontraditional environment averse making waves thats what justice ginsburg said apparently justice ginsburg thought there was problem which ought respond which what happening today the ball justice ginsburg concluded congress court the legislature may act correct this courts parsimonious reading that what are doing today that the right thing for our country the right thing for women the right thing for our families and that the aim the lilly ledbetter fair pay act this bill gives employees fair time limit take action against discrimination day limit will still stand but the clock reset after each violation the law should not simply after the first one and that change fits our commonsense understanding pay discrimination not single act but ongoing practice that renewed every time the employer signs unfair paycheck madam speaker pay discrimination anywhere attack the dignity every woman every workplace america when workers face unfair pay they should find standing their side not throwing technicalities and roadblocks the way equality for that reason urge every one colleagues male and female representatives all the people who ought have equal opportunity under the law this accomplishes that objective vote for this important piece legislation

speaker rise opposition the motion
speaker and members the house this motion little bit unbelievable the sense that suggests that should setting the attorneys fees even though the amount that the gentleman asking set far exceeds what would ordinary hourly wages fees these kinds cases across the nation the same time makes differentiation for geography complication cases number attorneys necessary case even the number firms that may dont know this applies all the attorneys the case with multiple plaintiffs whether this applies across the firm multiple attorneys firm are single case its complicated case and many cases these are very complicated cases because they business practices that are disguised terms trying justify unequal pay the name equal pay find rather interesting that the supporters this amendment across the aisle all stood and talked about how they support the idea equal pay how they want their daughters and their granddaughters treated equally how they want make sure that theyre treated fairly the workplace and they really support the concept they just dont support this bill which would make thatthe law but then what did they decide they decided when those granddaughters arent treated fairly the workplace they will discriminate against them ability have attorney they will discriminate against them because they will say that their attorneys fees are going capped according this law opposed letting the judge and the
the securities and exchange commission filed civil suit against one the people accused the wall street wrongdoing and there was proposal this floor that said the sec can spend much money wants its side the case but the wall street defendants accused the wrongdoing are capped how much they can spend their legal defenses think the members the minority would say thats unfair this interfere how much lawyers are paid matter the judges should take look under this law its not something this congress should interfere with and frankly believe diversionary tactic take away from the real purpose this law and thats woman that selling real estate teaching school sweeping floors should make penny for penny dollar for dollar everything man makes the same job that the issue before the house lets defeat this diversionary amendment lets pass the underlying bill and bring longawaited justice american women

madam speaker before yield the gentleman from maryland like thank him for extending the gratitude has this week very grateful for that for his spirit bipartisanship and his pledge work with this side the aisle look forward building constructive working relationship with the gentleman this our first colloquy together look forward the successive colloquies and this time yield friend from maryland the majority leader for purposes announcing next weeks schedule
thank the gentleman for yielding and before getting into the schedule let follow his remarks all the members this house know cantors predecessor blunt and are very good friends and worked closely together often disagree policy but have had longterm ability work together closely behalf the institution behalf the house the relationship think was one that was the benefit the house representatives and our members want thank cantor for visiting with and talking about how forward working together behalf the american people and behalf this institution know that well disagree perhaps more times than not major issues but also know that the objective that has and the objective have and the members this house both sides the aisle have stronger country with greater opportunity for our people want congratulate him his selection the republican whip and reiterate his comment that look forward working with him constructive and positive way madam speaker monday the house not session tuesday the house will meet for morning hour and for legislative business with votes postponed until wednesday and thursday the house will meet for legislative business friday votes are expected will consider several bills under suspension the rules the complete list suspensions the practice will announced the close business today will also consider bill expand the state childrens health insurance program will also consider house resolution requiring committees hold hearings upon receipt certain reports from inspector general the comptroller general the united states the presidentelect has made very clear wants look programs and ensure that the money being spent effectively and that the programs the money supports are effective addition will consider the tarp reform and accountability act which hope will set parameters accountability transparency and expectations for help with the mortgages for any legislation that might submitted either the bush administration the obama administration relates the second phase the second billion previously authorized the troubled asset recovery program thank the gentleman for yielding
thank the gentleman will say the gentleman that you have announced bill again limiting the uses the tarp funds know the chairman the financial services committee the gentleman from massachusetts has also announced broad outline for his bill and scheduled hearing would ask the gentleman from maryland the majority leader will the bill marked prior coming the floor and what sort rule can expect
believe will have rule that will certainly allow amendments you know thats franks practice believe believe its good practice whether not will have markup will depend upon the timeframe the problem the gentleman probably knows the american public and the congress both sides the aisle are very concerned that have consider within constricted timeframe the request either the bush administration during the latter days its term the beginning the obama administration get have second request for the second phase the tarp funding want have place conditions for the expenditure that money similar what have imposed the administration imposed but also legislatively imposed didnt pass the automobile companies for the receipt money the answer your question may not have the time the markup because are not sure when that second request coming down dont expect come down before consider this legislation but may come down shortly thereafter
thank the gentleman would like ask specifically would anything chairman franks bill prevent our members from having vote stop the additional billion bailout funds from being spent
will not obviously the legislation provides for resolution disapproval provides tight timeframe which that resolution should considered and nothing this bill will impact that
thank the gentleman for that would ask the gentleman madam speaker regarding the schip bill does the energy and commerce committee the ways and means committee plan holding hearing markup that bill
the answer that think not the bill however will very very much like perhaps not exactly because some the costs have changed and some the numbers may need adjusted but very much like the bill that passed bipartisan way with very substantial votes think somewhere the neighborhood votes through this house just some months ago believe the presidentelect very concerned that particularly the economic times confront saw another jobs lost this past month thats more than million jobs lost over the last days obviously all know that one the aspects losing job many instances losing your health insurance well are very concerned that will have lot children vulnerable america think there certainly majority opinion indeed president bush expressed his own thoughts that wanting include children think this another matter that need move very quickly but will almost exactly like not exactly like but very very much like very from substantive standpoint very little different than the bill that passed overwhelmingly the house and course twothirds the senate voted for well
would ask madam speaker along those lines nothing else the budget window has changed the gentleman recognized and the costs will likely more substantial have obviously new members this congress that have not had chance vote this bill even part the discussion may not have any experience this issue while have very little time review multibillion dollar authorization would ask the gentleman the bill coming the floor the form suspension noted madam speaker that was bipartisan vote was maybe members our side think the majority those members our side support the extension the existing schip program was wondering again the bill coming the floor suspension will have opportunity offer our amendments and suggestions under rule
the bill will come under rule that rule havent talked the committee chair havent talked waxman nor have talked
about the rule dont want represent what form the rule will but will not suspension bill furthermore think the gentlemans observation valid observation have many new members who did not consider are hopeful and working towards having that bill online available monday for full hours before would bring forward the floor for members see and the public see and all the members the house see
thank the gentleman for that the republicans under the leadership our leader john boehner will sending letter later today outlining our ideas for improving the schip program hopeful that under the rule that will have the ability have those ideas considered the house floor just presidentelect obama has advised proceed when the gentleman and and several others met with him earlier this week madam speaker would now like just make one additional inquiry the gentleman that three suspensions were considered wednesday would say the gentleman votes were over yesterday counted electoral ballots for the historical election barack obama were finished since legislative business was conducted and votes were taken after that can expect this the manner which the floor will scheduled each week
its hard predict what every week will look like the gentleman will soon find out you talk your leaders and the majority they will tell you more daunting than first appears having said that obviously the schedule has been submitted all the members all the members know what have scheduled terms days session hopefully they have notice that they are cognizant that particularly their schedulers are cognizant that have provided believe sufficient days which the work that the american public expects get done and that expect that needs done there are more days will add days having said that are obviously the first weeks the session lot has been going which not the floor simply getting organized the committees getting organized getting committee members appointed both the republican and the democratic sides that much has been going notwithstanding the fact there have been long days the floor but the early days the session obviously much going get ready for future floor action
thank the gentleman would also like just point out and make comment and suggestion that promote the efficient operation this house because have new members who have inquired why would finishing early each day and not working more that maybe could return our districts and with our constituents day that perhaps could save working more others there are legislative weeks scheduled between now and presidents day would ask the gentleman could lay out the calendar the legislative calendar for those weeks
thank the gentleman for his question you know the presidentelect was here this week discuss and has discussed gave speech regarding the recovery package obviously that important item that will considering you have heard the agenda for next week also need the omnibus some point time the near term will hopefully that before the presidents break will have other legislation but they will the two major items that will focused the recovery package and the omnibus appropriation bill clearly you know there are nine appropriation bills which were not completed last year that need completed that agencies will have the funding they need accomplish the objectives have given them

madam speaker wall streets biggest banks got congress hand over them billion your taxpayer money now they want more yesterday neel kashkari the interim assistant secretary for financial stability gave speech the brookings institution gave fancy sounding bureaucratic names the billion that has already forked over called capital purchase program asset grant guarantee program targeted investment program essentially was talking about the billion that went citigroup asked rhetorically when will see the new banks making loans well that part his job get them make the loans but said long confidence remains low banks will remain cautious about extending credit kashkari know that well the reason the auto industry trouble because credit has dried car loans cant made let get this straight wants more money because has only given billion from the taxpayers money out there the country the biggest banks that did the wrongdoing begin with and they are still reluctant lend let give kashkari dose reality your program isnt working and not working for main streets across this country pnc bank pittsburgh pennsylvania one the nations largest banks now the fifth largest bank has received billion from kashkari and instead providing additional lending capacity and loan workouts for those mortgages help resolve the problem pnc took the money and you know what they did they came across the border ohio and they bought national city bank cleveland see dear colleague from the city cleveland congressman kucinich here this evening understands this well national city has been headquartered institution ohio headquartered cleveland since now treasurys money the taxpayers money went pnc and they came ohio and bought national city bank putting all those people out work and pnc became bigger what kashkari did was take our money and give pnc that hasnt worked down any those loans but they came ohio and bought out national city bank pnc gets bigger our banking system gets more concentrated and pnc becomes more powerful some say they actually have price control power the western side pennsylvania pnc gets billion cleveland and ohio lose fortune company and ohio where foreclosures are raging gets nothing get nothing just get more foreclosures citigroup one the main culprits that caused the financial meltdown was given billion they got more than pnc they got from the taxpayer and then they have foreclosed just district another families lucas county ohio last november found advertisement local paper that said there was going auction home county was surprised didnt know the company coming called hudson and marshall dallas texas went guess what citigroup was one the banks selling properties attended and watched homes community sold for little price low that the original owners could have gone back into those homes not only was citigroup auctioning homes that night but were tarp money recipients those are the banks that got the money through the treasury from wells fargo bank deutsche bank abn amro chase home finance fifth third bank standard federal and lasalle they all got money clear that some the recipients the treasury money are unwilling craft real workouts and what happened our region was people got kicked out their homes wall street hired the auction company from dallas texas they came our region they sold all those properties for very little money and theyre going get big huge tax losses written off their irs filings for the tax year but where are our families out the street our people lost their homes would like invite kashkari secretary paulson and all the pnc executives come ohio and want them live the neighborhoods that their actions have affected well give them little heater bunsen heater overnight they dont get too cold the houses and wed like them experience the results what they have done the american people last year homes region were foreclosed upon the last years percent the properties home community have been foreclosed percent the housing stock and foreclosure rates continue rise places like ohio its pretty obvious thats whats happening here washington isnt connecting main street sadly hudson and marshall the auction house that wall street hired sell all those homes community are coming your town too this month alone they are slated several cities michigan arizona connecticut massachusetts rhode island and new jersey and theyre going auction another properties theyve now sold over homes the last few years and expect another the year kashkari your program isnt working madam speaker would like place the additional remarks that have the record what happening outrage the american people and theyre being asked pay for there shouldnt any more tarp bills clearing this congress until hearings are held the communities that have been affected need use our power order out the voters that sent here equity bleeding profusely from our communities the sheer volume the properties sold auction disturbing financial institutions which have been capitalized through the tarp program have failed mortgage workoutsfdic and sec should their jobs and they are not and must required mortgage workouts rather than foreclosing homes and participating auctions hudson marshall stated press release that they have made billion doing auctions the intent the tarp was help stabilize our financial system which includes large measure our housing industry yet financial institutions enriching themselves merging and yet foreclosing families rather than working stabilize families their homes stable home permits people focus obtaining and maintaining employment purchasing food and contributing society positive ways rather than relying social services funded state and federal dollars furthermore see communities falling apart community members and local banks are effectively locked out the opportunity reinvest themselves because monies from the department housing and urban development which would allow community banks andmembers purchase foreclosed homes have not yet arrived second round tarp money should emerge from this congress unless regular hearings are held and the victims this crisis can have their voices heard the deliberative process the committees should travel the communities most affected why should trust wall street banks again more families teeter the edge

thank colleague from tyler and longview and marshall and henderson and all points east fort worth appreciate his hosting this hour today talk about presidentelect obamas stimulus package very mindful that currently has something north percent approval rating you really dont want pick fight right off the bat with fella whos that high regard across the united states but think minimum ought give him chance begin put some meat the bone all these great ideas that have been kind thenot even the foot level but the foot level and looking forward the actual legislative language how some this stuff going work applaud him for calling for earmarks and for transparency and accountability thats exactly what want particularly encouraged that vice president biden has committed oversee the spending every single dollar personally given the growing size this bill going one very busy vice president puts his green eyeshade his garters and pulls his sleeves gets out his pen and actually watches the writing each one those checks committed doing the other day bit discouraged though that the overall process that was announced yesterday that believedour new president believes that can spend can collectively spend our way out this current economic recession depressionwhatev you want call whatever title you want give itim concerned that thats not accurate way this one way look this would say all right government spending panacea for the economy will build great economy then looking the spending the government spending for the last years which believe this federal government has spent more money the last years than any other year period historythat certainly didnt drive wonderful economy were bad economy right now the premise government spending builds economies then ought good economy right now quite frankly arent that economy the centerpiece both our colleagues have talked about job creation and the end the day really should about jobs participated needs assessment midland county back the united way days was zillion years ago was process where you went through and asked people what was going their homes what was going the neighborhoods local communities what were the problems what were the issues culled that down through some science the top needs for the midland community you looked those nine those would have been favorably addressed job somebody having job and arena where hyperbole the norm its difficult overstate how important jobs are economy and thats just the foundation the base those would also argue though that government jobs and colleague and from texas have two really good government jobs these government jobs that have make money and they are here forever and some government jobs will always here forever but the jobs that would created with the program thats been you know kind highlighted the foot level those jobs shouldnt forever and when you dont talk about forever with job then that job nature temporary and since its temporary its hard for families make plans based temporary job its hard for communities plan thosethe impact that those jobs have that temporariness those government jobs lends itself continued uncertainty continued anxiety about what happens when this ends what happens when this over opposed business that comes into locates into community begins put down roots and build jobs and build wealth add the local tax rolls all the kinds things the private sector jobs those have sense permanency them that just right that makes sense and would argue that whatever goforward basis that focus more private sector jobs and whatever can avoid creating government jobs because once you put people the government payroll its hard get them off and does not build wealth would also like point out that while our current circumstances are dire and difficult and hard and there lot pain the country right now temporary weve seen expanding economies are temporary weve enjoyed about year good run with the expanding economy everybody enjoys that new jobs are created new wealth created opportunities everybody likes that but those are temporary weve now seen with this contracting economy well the converse true well contracting economies are temporary they may last lot longer than wed like lot longer than wed enjoy but the end the day this world economy this economy will turn the corner and will begin expand look what address this issue lets careful that dont take money earned future generations fix temporary issue that were dealing with would argue that colleagues and generation the last years have elevated this idea taking somebody elses moneyin most instances its our grandkids and great grandkids and greatgreat grandchildrens moneyand lets fix todays problems which means that have robbed our future generations the money that theyre going earn that they should have available them address their problems because they will have problems there nothing can today thats going fix everything permanently and those future generations have right the money they earn the sweat their brow the problem you and are spending collectively theres plenty blame around this isnt partisan issue democrats republicans bear equal blame this regard that weve constantly become addicted effect using borrowed money address issues and the issue were going address over the next several weeks this economy and everything ive heard far that were going use borrowed money was fredericksburg texas back october doing town hall meeting elementary school colleagues have never done town hall meeting elementary school would encourage because you get some the best questions ever from fifth graders was doing best kind thing and this little fella the second row raised his hand and recognized him and said congressman what the plan pay off the national debt and said excuse said yes sir whats the plan pay off the national debt and said young man that the single best question have been asked while ive been congress there plan pay off the national debt every dollar that borrow effect permanently borrowed forever lets just take example cpa some this comes little bit easy weve got trillion hard debt debt weve got paper not counting the promises social security medicare and all that weve got trillion order pay that off this government has run trillion surplus counting the interest its more than that youve got interest given the history the last years weve think run surpluses those years thirtynine them fortyone them whatever the number have been deficits anyone their right mind thinks this federal government given the propensity have for spending other peoples money can run trillion surplus order pay off the national debt they are delusional beyond all words now minimum the first thing that ought quit doing whats gotten this point quit spending money dont have you know its across the aisle weve got two seemingly desperate ways doing things our side want cut taxes and the other side spends money but doesnt raise taxes ought this way youre going spend the money then have the political backbone raise the taxes youre not going raise the taxes have the political backbone not spend the money well weve had our side where spent the money and borrowed and the other side wants spend the money and raise taxes and all weve done spend money that dont have its not ours family gets that small business gets that other government entity aware other than the federal government gets that preference were going have some sort stimulus work would focus tax policy the money thats earned good citizens and that the point badge take away from them that tax policy ought stable ought predictable ought put place allows them keep more their money and create those private sector jobs lets take the example businesses section allows businesses deduct immediately the year purchase certain amount money that they spend equipment that they use their business being able deduct that the taxes they would otherwise have paid that amount money they can recycle into their business hiring new people investing new product investing new capacity all those kinds things that view much more appropriate stimulus the economy than collect bunch money here washington and then begin try parcel out across some the projects that our colleague from new jersey was talking about earlier terms how that money going spent under the quoteunquote stimulus package and the conference mayors you know the shopping list that theyve gone through view much better way try stimulate this economy truth told the end the day the federal government has precious little with whether not the economy expands contracts thats driven the decisions millions americans decide whether not theyre going buy something new whether not theyre making enough money able afford that whether not their businessprospects for their business good enough that theyll the bank and borrow money and continue begin turn this corner those decisions are made all over the united states all over the world good honest folks and not governments sometimes delude ourselves into thinking thatand most are the kind personality that came here fix stuff came here make this country better place came here all those kinds things sometimes its not our job our propensity that want fix stuff want things help this country and when see problem staggering and difficult this one think that theres something fact can and feel almost inadequate when propose not doing something but maybe this instance letting absorb the pain and understand that deleveraging circumstance when youre paying off debt are right now that that does not grow economy but that does lay the foundation for that future economy that will begin expand that will all enjoy forward basis anybody remembers one thing ive said today lets begin look and lay foundation for stopping fixing temporary problems with permanent debt that were borrowing from future generations and are hamstringing them and are hobbling their ability take care their issues when they are grown and our position appreciate colleague for hosting this hour today
thank friend from midland conaway guess its that trained certified public accountant mind that sees with such clarity you know youve got your debits and your credits and you come here congress and should balance and appreciate the clarity that all your training and experience has given ran across some quotes here that are right line with what friend from midland has been saying heres quote from richard wagner professor economics george mason university said the government can increase its spending only reducing private spending equivalently whether government finances its added spending increasing taxes borrowing inflating the currency the added spending will offset reduced private spending furthermore private spending generally more efficient than the government spending that would replace because people act more carefully when they spend their own money than when they spend other peoples money what insightful quote another quote congress and presidentelect obama work together help middle class families and get our economy back track the deficit estimate makes clearer than ever that cannot borrow and spend our way back prosperity when were already running annual deficit more than trillion the reality that the decisions make today will impact future generations and burying our children and grandchildren under mountain debt pay for more wasteful government spending would the height irresponsibility ive come know many wonderful people both sides the aisle years that ive been here there may somebody this body that doesnt like children but dont know who would find commonality just real love for children you see children come onto the floor under are allowed here saw the rostrum the dais just completely covered with children speaker pelosi was sworn and children just bring smile when you see these wholesome refreshing children bright eyes full hope gathered around but breaks your heart when you realize the kind debt were loading these children with mean nobody this body know would intentionally about harming any child but were doing unintentionally has historically been the general nature mankind its not true with all species but with mankind generallyexcept for some exceptions some really horrible peoplemankinds nature protect our children and this body while ive been here weve continued load them and presidentelect obama talked about change and hope and frankly the democrats had been spending way too much money the eighties and the there were few years there where republicans were doing the right thing and then they couldnt help themselves they started spending money like crazy loading the kids with more debt than they will ever able pay and was reallyand stillholding out hope that the change that can get and need the most from this administration coming quit killing our children with debt just overloading them with debt and you know the change not going come throwing money the economy weve been doing that for the last months has accomplished nothing there are some great insightful writings and thoughts from economists now that although was the most incredibly good intentions through the thirties the economy did not get help despite all the massive spending and government programs until world war people here have heard say many times think the number one duty the federal government provide for the common defense need have defense spending and invariably every time administration comes and seeks their cuts cutting the military cutting spending with defense contractors then our military gets low point and president ronald reagan had said you know country ever gets attacked because people perceive being too strong they perceive being vulnerable they attack always good thing and preventative when nation strong militarily dont need cutting the military dont need cutting defense spending fact when the government going spend and help the economy ought things that government has anyway when look some the proposed projects which funding being sought and maybe spent some the things that have been listed far being ready shovel ready ready have money for albuquerque new mexico fitness center need make our people more physically fit have been deeply troubled that with all the emphasis child left behind weve cut art programs weve cut music programs weve cutall kinds programs that really can make people more whole person and that includes physical fitness you know when was kid and president kennedy proposed physical fitness for children really didnt like thought ought mind his own business actually but can tell you that the physical fitness programs that were institutedand that wasnt mandate wasnt requirement was encouragement led encouraging and schools started having physical fitness programs and the kids got better off physically which made them better off mentally and see the obesity that has resulted dont need federal government start telling people you cant buy fast foods you cant eat this you cant eat that just everybody exercise and then push that with the children set those good patterns early and that will take care itself teaches discipline and that something that far too many this body have not been able overcome now one the things that you learn law school rationalize almost anything you get good you become good lawyer you get good rationalizing basically any conductor you can and see people that have been here congress for many years many that did not law school and they have gotten good cut president reagan and had rationalizing they can rationalize doubledigit inflation had doublemost anything dont need digit unemployment were not even doing that need getting close doubledigit inflation but what helps keep throwing away money and but ive heard people try ration printing money like crazy and boralize this floor this congress rowing and trying tax more then the years ive been here and never were headed for major major trouble seek impose religious beliefs but you back the late sevenanyone else but enjoy when people ties early eighties and the research quote scripture and ive heard scrip weve done indicates that key industure quoted this floor many times tries that experienced big downturn but often its during tax debate and result the recession the late ive heard people ridiculing you know seventies early eighties were housing some you republicans say youre steel manufacturing and automobile christian but jesus said take care production and these did not see rethe widows and orphans jesus said covery until much later even youve done the least might also say for those who look these children youve done for answers scripture referred jesus said unto others you would earlier when people have criticized have them unto you and here for not wanting take other peoples you guys are wanting cut give away money give away charity programs all these different people choice that they would prefer but ive searched scripture and for brought that and someone said those who like rely you can well thats not being very christian look jesus never said there and point them the example fore use and abuse your taxing author zacchaeus because you look ity take somebody elses money and zacchaeus and his example the first give away said you you thing did after met jesus was you individually you help cut taxes and fact not only did you reach out you give with your cut taxes gave fourforone remoney you give with what you have bate recall those who had dont goabusing your power mem wronged and have doubt that ber congress take from somebody cutting taxes after met jesus that else give and you will the stimulated the economy all around beneficiary that was the teaching not because meant the government for government take other peoples wasnt getting that money the tax colmoney because what taxation its lectors werent getting that money theft although legalize there people were able spend their own fore its legal theft take somebody now was really amazed when some elses money and use the way bipartisan group members want use congress went china few years that concern heres another ago and talking ceos and since quote from assistant professor then talking other ceos why was onomics justin ross from the school your industry moved china because public and environmental affairs figure the answer going indiana university says the cheaper labor didnt have deal pirical evidence overwhelmingly with labor unions easier environjects federal government deficit mentalthe number one answer was spending the best method for stimu not any those things they said our lating the economy and generally quality control was good the unsupportive having any stimulus united states americans just really effect all saw that all through make good products the thirties matter how much money the government gave away matter how many government pro but the number one answer was that grams there was nothing permanent the corporate tax rate china was about what was done much cheaper than here and you now hear lot people say that look around the world where econothis the worst economy years mies are growing and they have and years going back the thir dropped corporate rates they have ties rivals those days was men dropped capital gains rates people tioning before but had man over are able keep more their own years old approach district money say was sick and tired people say and what see have seen over ing that that what were going and over going back president kenthrough right now has comparison nedy president reagan and the early for people that are out work even days president bush when you drop has comparison the because the tax rate the economy encourthere were times said when aged expands and you get even more would couple days without even revenue back into the coffers the eating and now people get upset and government everybody comes out think theyre broke they dont have ahead two three cars computers cell now some the other things weve phones and that kind thing they heard about the democratic stimulus had none that package that being worked that and you back the late seven could virtually triple the current ties early eighties before the big tax years deficit what weve been hearing that will grow deficit thats about percent increase over the postworld war record percent also weve been told friend from new jersey alluded that percent the million jobs that presidentelect obama wants create are government dont produce whole lot government some would say what produce not worth producing and more harmful than good regardless dont need new government jobs that overloading the economy with government and former senator gramm used say when have more people the wagon than pulling the wagon the wagons going stop and the country will economically dead that point spending though disguised tax cuts not tax cut many writers have said want stimulate the economy what really need have tax cut thats why filed december and have refiled the first day were session this week month tax holiday bill hoping that will get talk with someone the incoming administration because presidentelect obama said wanted provide tax cut for every american who made less than bill makes sure every wage earner including selfemployed businesses get twotwelfths tax cut for the year its not just stimulus package but that the result but the fact this body allowed people who earned the money choose winners and not give money people and companies they think are losers then they make the decisions and can guarantee you theyre going make better decisions than weve seen out the treasury department over the last months its like were reading moment ago when people spend their own money they more wisely than when theyre spending someone elses money especially when have the problems with accountability that government always has doesnt matter which administration office when there money given away the government accountability nightmare its huge problem and despite all the promises have got republican administration thats been office the last months during this huge bailout but have had democratic majority the house democratic majority the senate and matter which party charge accountability has been disastrous when comes holding peoples feet the fire with government money not the answer throwing money all these different things other proposed giveaways would million for parking garage the orange bowl miami what great bowl what great venue for football but there doesnt need federal giveaway million for greton florida bottle water with recycled bottles well thats wonderful noble goal but what government should create incentives for other people good things theres been too much problem with congress that decide were just going give away money throw problem and think have done good thing the highest and best use this body over and above making sure that provide for the common defense encouraging people the best that they can with what they have use their talents use their godgiven potential one the things that drove off the bench district judge and made want run for this office get serve here was judge handling felonies kept seeing more and more women come into court that had sentence for couple things one was for welfare fraud and another was for their involvement dealing drugs and you get complete presentence investigation report peoples background and was amazed how similar many the stories were and this not racial issue because when dealt with there were women all races having the same problem they would have somebody encourage them because they were bored with high school drop out and have baby because the government will send you check they would drop out have baby and theyd get government check and then theyd find out its not really enough for baby and woman live they would have another child and another child and they kept getting further and further behind and you back the and the great society and how wellintentioned that was but what occurred was the government saw single women having provide for children with some deadbeat dad out there not helping with the best intentions and wanting help they said lets give them check they started giving check for every child that woman could have out wedlock and when they come years later court sentenced over and over seeing women who are lured into this rut the federal government wellintentioned giveaways and they couldnt get out provided them incentive get out hear from people housing projects that said you know were trying save nest egg could move out federal housing someday and buy our own home were saving down payment then were told some authorities that had too much money savings that either had buy stuff give away spend somehow get rid wed have move out federal housing mean whats wrong with this the federal government ought about encouraging people whats good for them because ultimately thats good for the country and instead lure people into rut and dont let them out and some women would get desperate and theyd realize ive got get job but also need handout from the government with the children they get job they wouldnt report that the federal welfare authorities and theyd come before criminals for welfare fraud others would see how much money was being made dealing drugs and thats way out rut and wasnt because thats bad for everybody but you come back the premise the federal government luring people into rut with giveaway programs that dont let them out now not sure exactly what the answer was the specifically but know what the general answer the government should provide incentives the right thing instead you know giving people check and luring them into this rut they can never get out maybe give them incentives finish their education help with day care had done that wouldnt see this boom over the last years children without enough parents that care about them thats what encouraged and seriously weve gotten what weve paid for could drop the corporate tax could drop the cap gains tax get sick and tired hearing people saying well never get manufacturing jobs back the united states ridiculous course can theyve left because corporate taxes are lot cheaper elsewhere and people that come this floor and say lets dont tax the people lets tax the corporations that disingenuous because the fact corporations they dont pass that and make their customers and clients pay then they dont stay business the corporation doesnt pay that tax its conduit but comes from the individuals getting their services but seems good passing the buck congress when that but the detroit news itself home our automakers say tax cuts work best stimulate the economy congress agrees take this enormous debt the name stimulating the economy better everything possible keep from becoming historys biggest pork barrel the pittsburgh paper said club for growths pat toomey urges the elimination the capital gains rate would the better solution thats what really needed what national reviews larry kudlow said fool bore supplyside tax rate reduction that could even morph into fullfledged corporate tax reform that would amazing wed get those jobs back overnight and then with energy weve had this big energy debate the last months and now people have gone sleep the issue should not have still got get energy independent and heard from experts who said will simply open anwr isnt beautiful pristine area that often depicted television theres nothing there its flat theres not better place earth drill because theres nothing there animals cant live there the caribou come they have pass through immediately because theres nothing there live drill there wed have tiny footprint and were told that immediately wed have new jobs and the time they were ready for production there would million new jobs theres third presidentelect obamas promise million new jobs and dont have give money away dont have increase taxes the private sector will take care all have make sure the environmental concerns are addressed that dont hurt the environment could increase the jobs immediately opening more the outer continental shelf what incredible stimulus that would boston herald editorial said real stimulus billthe expiring tax cuts are tax increases and history shows that tax increases recession depression recovery can deadly should not there often look the seal the dollar bill has pyramid with triangular eye actually the top representing the allseeing eye god and the latin phrase annuit coeptis thats latin meaning god has smiled our undertaking when saddle those dear sweet children that are alive today and their children with debt because would not the right thing dont see how god anybody else can smile our undertaking need get back things that bring smiles
madam speaker plan use the first twothirds time focus events the iddle east and then the final third focus our economy would invite colleagues who wish address these subjects come the floor can yield them few minutes but dont have any company capable speaking for full hour some more bored colleagues have already seen proven now even hourlong presentation not going able present all the facts support position and invite colleagues visit brad sherman mail house gov now focusing the middle east all want peace all want sustainable ceasefire but instead our televisions show blood and carnage who blame what cause stop now the issue who blame the press has remarkably silly approach they take pictures casualties and they decide whatever side has suffered the most casualties must the right would point out that this the standard use america has been the wrong every war have fought since absolutely preposterous say that whichever side suffers the greater casualties has morality their side part this misreading the just war theory that many modern philosophers have put together and one its key elements proportionality the press skimming rather than reading these philosophical texts comes with the idea that there must proportionality one sides casualties the other sides casualties true reading just war theory indicates that the proportionality doctrine that there must proportionality between the objective that the just side seeking and the casualties which are unfortunately borne both sides well what the objective that israel seeking first and foremost the objective end situation where million israelis every day and every night face daily attempts kill and maim many them possible this standard this just effort the israeli government safeguard its people now hamas has sent since well over rockets and mortars into southern israel now want clarify one issue the number because often you will hear figure roughly half that the correct figure for the number rockets for the number mortars but you add together the rockets and the mortars since the year the number stands well over why pick that because that the time when israel withdrew completely unilaterally without concession without compensation from the gaza strip leaving behind valuable assets which were trampled rather than used hamas extremists see some rockets and mortars from territory that hardly under israeli occupation are told that well hamas should regarded morally virtuous because few these rockets hit their target true that the vast majority these projectiles have failed their attempts kill israeli women and children and civilians but that doesnt mean that hamas has good morality simply indicates that hamas has bad aim more specifically that they are using ordnance which very difficult for them aim every one those rockets and mortars had single objective kill many israeli civilians possible not single one them was targeted the israeli military are told well let count only the casualties let ignore the over attempts murder from hamas cannot ignore those missiles from moral standpoint just wrong fire missile that fails hit its civilian target one that does hit its civilian target now earlier today the house passed res the vote was percent favor percent against the remaining percent either voted present wasnt present percent percent let review some the provisions that resolution will read some and then will comment whereas hamas was founded with the stated goal destroying the state israel whereas hamas has been designated the united states foreign terrorist organization whereas hamas has refused comply with the quartets and here are referring the united states european union russia and the united nations that quartets requirements that hamas recognize israels right exist then goes say that hamas has launched thousands rockets against israels population centers since and has launched more than such rockets and mortars into israel since israel withdrew both its military and civilians from gaza the resolution also states that june after that withdrawal hamas illegally crossed into israel attacked israeli forces and kidnapped corporal gilad shalit whom they continue hold today the resolution then points out that hamas getting some very substantial support from iran and will address that later and using innocent civilians human shields let give one illustration that and that nizar rayyan perhaps one hamas top leaders stored weapons his home sophisticated communications designed act communications center for hamas what did israel they called him his home they told him that order avoid civilian casualties they were giving him minutes notice thats enough time for people leave the area but that was important israel destroy those weapons destroy that communications equipment what did rayyan having boasted that wanted die martyr not only stayed the house but kept with him several his wives and children that the use innocent human shields its worst man doing everything possible lead the death cause the death his four wives many his children all could claim that israel was responsible for the deaths those civilians let continue look key provisions the resolution that passed the house whereas israel has facilitated humanitarian aid gaza with hundreds trucks carrying humanitarian assistance let provide the specifics just today some humanitarian shipments went from israel gaza including tons food medicine plus liters heavyduty diesel that gaza can operate its power generation station and tons gas for domestic use that what israel made sure risk its own people would reach gaza just today well how does that compare with combatants other wars look world war and world war each those wars the british navy used its total mastery the surface the oceans blockade germany not single ship medicine was allowed pass across the atlantic germany not single ship food and course prior both world war and world war germany was major food importer from the western hemisphere what did germany they deployed their submarines with the stated purpose starving the british both world war and world war sinking many ships possible laden with food purchased the new world world war and world war both combatants from the first day the war did everything possible stop single ship humanitarian assistance use modern nomenclature stop single ship with food medicine from reaching its destination compare israel both sides world war risking its own soldiers and civilians order help those trucks get through the resolution continues with quotation from secretary rice where she said january january hundreds thousands israelis lived under daily threat rocket attack and frankly country would willing tolerate such circumstance moreover the people gaza watched insecurity and lawlessness increased and their living conditions grew more dire because hamas actions which began with the illegal coup against the palestinian authority gaza ceasefire that returns those circumstances unacceptable and will not last will not last the security council passed resolution last night calling for sustainable ceasefire but ceasefire that returns hamas the situation that existed december the words our own secretary state unacceptable because will not last the has called not for temporary ceasefire but for sustainable ceasefire now the resolution goes its resolved clauses make number points for example the resolution subparagraph encourages the administration work actively support durable and sustainable ceasefire gaza soon possible that prevents hamas from retaining rebuilding its terrorist infrastructure including the capability launch rockets and mortars against israel paragraph calls all nations condemn hamas for deliberately embedding its fighters leaders and weapons private homes schools mosques hospitals and otherwise using palestinian civilians human shields while simultaneously targeting israeli civilians paragraph the resolution calls for the immediate release the kidnapped israeli soldier gilad shalit who has been illegally held gaza since june would point out that least believe that ceasefire can regarded adequate unless includes the return gilad shalit these are the provisions and havent had chance quote them all but these are what think are the most important provisions the resolution passed this house vote percent percent want commend chairman berman and speaker pelosi for introducing and writing this resolution and was proud one its original cosponsors let try review some the elements that see the ground the middle east hamas claims beleaguered but has rejected the security council ceasefire resolution passed last night hamas has done everything increase civilian casualties including the actions rayyan and including the use human shields yet spite all hamas efforts increase civilian casualties both sides estimates state that over twothirds the palestinian casualties have been guntoting militant terrorists and other estimates put that number well over threequarters testament everything israel has done risking the lives its own soldiers order minimize palestinian civilian casualties that well over half well over twothirds the palestinian casualties are indeed the militants not the civilians when hamas launches rockets from neighborhood israeli sergeant has seconds decide whether return fire now there always comfortable pundit talking head television airconditioned studio ready vilify that decision but the decision has made seconds israeli sergeant under fire the moral culpability for civilian casualties cannot put the feet any sergeant moral culpability for the horrors war lies with politicians who seek extreme and unjust ends through violent means while israel seeks live peace alongside palestinian state hamas and its political leaders have their clearly stated objective kill expel every jew from the middle east hamas proudly waives the banner genocide and ethnic cleansing where lay the blame for the casualties that continue believe not the feet the sergeant who under fire but rather the feet the political leaders who insist upon continuing seek such unjust and extreme ends through violent means now have discussed this conflict conflict between just israel and hamas fact conflict wider significance conflict between the government iran and the people and allies the united states the fighting gaza has demonstrated irans ability and desire wage war america and its allies hamas terrorist organization seeking the destruction israel favor islamic palestinian state but also proxy for the iranian government such what see the middle east part regional war being waged the iranian regime against the united states and its allies many llamas weapons are made iran many top hamas military leaders and experts who launched the missiles into israel were trained iran iran provides the lions share hamas funding unlikely that hamas would able achieve its status the premier palestinian terrorist organization without backing from iran iran backed hamas like iran backed hezbollah shoots rockets israels civilians from deep inside their own densely populated civilian areas knowing that any israeli attempt defend itself will kill least endanger palestinian civilians through hamas and hezbollah and through its operatives iraq iran and its government are able stir crises the middle east thus injuring american prestige while helping achieve irans own aims know that iran working hard possess nuclear bomb with all that iran doing now with all that has done far from its own country blowing the jewish center the city buenos aires what will iran like has nuclear weapons will act with impunity will from crisis crisis between the and its allies and iran and each time will staring hostile nuclear power now true that the last time went eyeballtoeyeball with hostile nuclear power namely the soviet union best exemplified the cuban missile crisis lived tell about but imagine going eyeballtoeyeball with regime that considerably less sane than khrushchev and not having one cuban missile crisis but crisis every time fran decides test every time engages international terrorism this risk americans should not take finally what happens many pray this regime tehran feels that going swept out power they may decide nuke tel aviv effort regain popularity among those the street iran they may decide smuggle weapon into the united states feeling that they are going out they would just soon out with bang unacceptable for america sleep while the centrifuges spin natanz now preventing iranian nuclear weapon still possible the new administration reorients our foreign policy make that its chief objective the good news that the tools have available the diplomatic tools the economic tools isolate the government tehran have only been his used the extent percent still have lot tools the tool box the bad news for this entire administration even after even after was revealed iranian dissident group all the details proving that iran was making considerable progress nuclear bomb even after all that this administration has left most the tools the tool box will detail some those tools the time that remains and the rest course are available for colleagues view bradsherman house gov first can begin the effort economic isolation think incoming presidentelect obama has strong record voted for the lautenberg amendment which unfortunately didnt pass because majority senators voted against that amendment would simply have prevented oil companies from doing business with iran through their foreign subsidiaries furthermore then senator obama authored the bill the last congress which would have encouraged divestment from firms doing business with iran hope very much that its first days the obama administration comes congress and urges pass these two pieces legislation that were strongly supported senator obama then need ask the administration and odd constitutional circumstance where have ask that laws enforced but should ask the administration begin enforcing the iran sanctions act the current administration and even the prior administration refused need the diplomatic level demand that the world bank stop disbursing funds iran the form concessionary loans basically acquiesced the decisions the world bank make those loans fortunately only half the funds have been disbursed and must make clear the world bank that our continued participation that organization requires the immediate cessation disbursements from the world bank the government iran need deny nuclear cooperation agreements countries that provide technologies iran and technologies mean those technologies that help iran develop nuclear weapons and need organize the world hit one irans achilles heels and that the fact that needs import gasoline because although iran oil rich does not have refinery capacity almost half its gasoline needs imported this effort have the opportunity report the house that have had some success has been reported that major indian refinery ril has agreed stop sending refined petroleum products iran this success for the government and particularly for the congress the united states why because this very refinery india was seeking funding from the exportimport bank one our major funding institutions fund the construction infrastructure around the world and that chiefly because products being used that infrastructure ril was seeking exportimport bank loan loan guarantee and several members congress joined with sending letter that institution saying that exim bank should not provide such financing unless the refinery stopped shipping gasoline iran look forward using these and other tools convince the iranian people and iranian elites that their policy the policy their government supporting terrorism and building nuclear weapons going lead their economic and diplomatic isolation think also owe special debt gratitude the mullahs who run the iranian government because their incredible corruption and inefficiency has left the iranian economy very susceptible these pressures very fragile this economy iran was fragile even when oil was selling for roughly barrel and they are far more fragile now that oil selling between and barrel let review just few the other things that this government and this congress can order get the message across iranian elites and the iranian people that they face economic and diplomatic isolation they continue support terrorism and develop nuclear weapons the first these urge americans divest from ownership stock cbmpanies that are investing the iranian oil sector how can this first need make clear and this legislation that passed the house unfortunately believe did noti know did not make through the senate simply tell pension plans and other trustees that they are free divest without the risk lawsuits from some crazy investor beneficiary who somehow would claim that the fund could make more money did invest companies doing business iran weve got make plain that one hasa fiduciary duty invest terrorism second would want change our tax laws that those selling stock company usually foreign oil company that investing the iranian oil sector and investing the stock different company that those who engage such transaction are not immediately taxed rather they should get what tax professionals call carryover basis and then when they divest when they sell the stock the new company the company thats doing good things that would the time when they would recognize their capital gain because divestiture companies doing business with iran way bolster its energy sector divestment should not result lawsuits should not result taxation should result accolades and thanks from this congress see that american pension plans both public and private and american individuals are willing step forward and put some economic pressure the iranian government addition think that have examine our relationship with russia and china with lens looking how russia and china deal with iran too often these two super powers former super powers future super powers whatever term you would use for russia and china these two powerful countries use their seat the security council defend iran from any meaningful sanctions why they this first and foremost they because they can knowing full well that our policy toward china russia the issues they care about will not affected what they choose iran this failure linkage needs end with the end this administration need state department and president and foreign policy that makes plain russia that when look georgia when look transdniester moldova when look disputes involving the pricing natural gas when look whether were putting missile defense poland and the czech republic when were looking any issue important moscow our first question will what has russia done hinder help the iranian nuclear program nothing illustrates this better than our plan put missile defense the czech republic and poland justified the current administration the theory that need that because iran may have nuclear icbms now how crazy this anger russia putting the missile defense the czech republic and poland what instead should agree not build that missile defense russia will help prevent iran from having nuclear weapons which was the theoretical reason needed the missile defense keep mind that missile defense not going safeguard poland the czech republic from iranian nuclear weapons first probably wont work but even did iranian missiles are not aimed krakow prague iranian missiles would probably not the mechanism that iran would use deliver nuclear weapons you see develop icbm you have damn good rocket scientist actually have bunch damn good rocket scientists but you not have rocket scientist get nuclear weapon into american city nuclear weapon about the size person and course those sizes vary nuclear weapons but not that hard smuggle something the size person into the united states fact our efforts along the mexican border have raised the price that smugglers charge for that very activity from dollars that may deter some who would cross the border illegally for economic reasons that may deter poor people from latin america but obviously isnt going deter any country with nuclear weapons likewise could point out that not have single border officer the entire alaska canadian border not one you think that well were going defend los angeles and chicago because have this incredible border effort have zero that border and iran could easily could smuggle weapon into anchorage even more easily than smuggle one into los angeles washington new york why are building missile defense the czech republic and poland and doing angering moscow and making more difficult for pass appropriate resolutions sanctioning iran through the united nations security council first myopia has marked much the foreign policy the current administration and second peculiar belief that building missile defense the czech republic and poland are somehow tying those two countries and continuing the cold war against russia should building missile defense only think will work will not work against iran and theres second reason iran will choose smuggle nuclear weapons rather than use intercontinental ballistic missiles because they will have more confidence their ability smuggle even they have icbm theyre not sure works theyre certainly not sure that hits the target within miles within half mile what theyre trying achieve they know they can smuggle nuclear weapon precisely the location they want right outside the security perimeter this capitol right outside the front gate the white house and addition iran would prefer have plausible deniability why should they make clear that the bomb came from the iranian government instead delivered terrorist they can always say you dare not retaliate wasnt our fault iran would prefer plausible deniability just bin ladin denied then admitted then denied responsibility for are building missile defense the czech republic and poland for reason that enhances american security and great cost our effort prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons likewise have made all too clear beijing that our attitudes toward their currency manipulation will not affected the slightest what they with regard iran particularly the united nations why would take the number threat our national security and tell the chinese wont link anything you care about again this has been ineffective foreign policy the outgoing administration look forward diplomatic policy that gives the highest priority putting sanctions iran long develops nuclear weapons and supports terror look forward using all the economic sanctions available and look forward being able use our broadcasting resources inform the iranian government and people that they face true isolation economically and diplomatically they continue down the same path this point want move from foreign policy our economic situation next week this congress will consider bill amending the tarp program tarp the program that known the billion bailout bill billion has been spent this administration the other billion remains available the next administration now that second billion will not available the new administration until the administration makes request and until have chance privileged resolution vote resolution disapproval but should point out that would virtually impossible for this congress prevent any administration making such formal request from getting the second billion that because any resolution disapproval would have pass both houses congress then sustain presidential veto and both houses would have override that veto the second billion likely become available the executive branch before that should strengthen the requirements for expenditure the second billion now there are variety ways strengthen the requirements there are three that have focused most directly chairman frank has focused quite number other ways strengthen the tarp program and agree with most what will trying should point out that speaking the basis the outline posted the speakers web page and believe the web page the financial services committee well not yet have the bills text but from that outline see one majorimprovement focusing one the three issues that have focused and that requirement that when invest financial institution receive least minimum number warrants now frankly should getting lot more warrants than the minimum that would established chairman franks legislation but the current tarp bill has minimum all can raise that percent minimum and make plain the department the treasury that the minimum floor not ceiling and that the taxpayers this country deserve warrants commensurate with the risk that are taking then will much stronger position because lets face were investing the preferred stock quite number these banks different sizes and some those investments will fail dont make profit the good ones our kids are going paying for enormous increase the federal deficit result the bad investments have made the way this set percent the floor but expect that where substantial risks are taken that get warrants worth percent the amount that the federal government investing there second area that have focused all the tarp discussions and that concern that will bailing out foreign entities not just american entities that this would take the form buying bad bonds that were invested and owned not entities but big banks shanghai and riyadh and london now until now contrary the plan that secretary paulson presented this house has not spent single penny buying bad bonds from anybody course told that was the only thing was going use the money for changed his mind the moment passed the bill but the new administration may indeed decide buy troubled assets bad bonds from those who invested them this the case they should only buy such bonds they were held american entity september which the day that all this bubbled the surface the day secretary paulsons original proposal when say american investor include american investors those entities incorporated the united states doing business the united states even they are owned foreign entities firemans fund happens owned entity outside the united states they are still very much part the business activity here the united states and the bond was actually owned the entity should eligible for purchase under tarp but very different thing allow what call the china twostep the china twostep works like this the bank shanghai made some bad investments you know everybody around the world bought our bad bonds mortgagebacked securities whatever you want call them they bought some really bad bonds shanghai transfers those some entity monday and then the treasury buys them tuesday the china twostep need put into the statute that before any bond purchased before any troubled asset purchased know that was owned investor including those entities that may have foreign parents but was owned investor september the third issue that concerned about and that now think all colleagues our colleagues are concerned about the issue executive compensation and perks now the outlineand only working from the outline thats posted the web pagedoes say that those who receive bailout moneys cannot own lease private jets but leavesit clear that they can charter the private jets better should take the private jet provision out the law entirely than commit fraud the american people and say that the executives companies which needed bailout are not going have private jets and and behold instead owning jets they charter them should make clear that chartered luxury aircraft cannot used those who receive bailouts and should provide exception should provide exception where the destination place very far from scheduled air service should focus not only perks but the total compensation package now the automobile bailout bill that passed this house but did not pass the senate did provide limits bonuses paid the executives the bailedout firm what need make clear that any grant stock option covered whether not called bonus because the creativity the corporate world enormous aig said when they paid millions dollars executives just last month those werent bonuses those were retention payments given the ability some the corporate world say its not bonus just because quacks like bonus walks like bonus you can sure that there are those the corporate world who think that granting stock option not bonus why are stock options important because the stock prices the bailedout entities are currently trading very low thats why they need bailout you give executive the right buy thousands and thousands shares his company and buy each share for todays price you are perhaps providing that executive with tens millions with hundreds millions dollars worth options therefore important that not allow stock options granted allow stock grantedeither oneto executives firms that receive bailout some will ask what about those companies that took money from paulson and didnt know that there would tough restrictions the answer simple give back the money firm should required live under these tough provisions longer wants hold taxpayers money but theyve got taxpayer money they ought either live under the restrictions return addition bonuses and stock options addition chartered aircraft should point out that goldman sachs one the companies that holding our bailout money paid quarter million dollars last year for luxury limo for just one executive there are some other perks for limit but addition perks and bonuses ought look salaries because some these executives are getting millionamonth salaries think company receiving tarp funds they should limit the total compensation package every executive mere million and when say total compensation package that has got count everything that counts the salary the bonus the pension plan contributions and the stock options now not certain that everything suggesting here will the bill consider next week fear that the bill will prohibit bonuses but will little unclear about stock options that will prohibit leasing the corporate jets but will allow the companies charter the corporate jets and that will put limits bonuses but limits salaries the question then difficult one for those who were skeptical about the initial bill vote put some additional restrictions knowing that they are insufficient vote against will analyzing that issue carefully but will say this pass bill next week that imposes additional restrictions hope bill that considered under regular order let mark the bill the financial services committee and the amendments that ive alluded here fail pass the committee the house ill happy vote for the bill knowing that these issues have least been discussed but are confronted with bill that step forward but not considered regular order which there markup committee and are not allowed consider amendments substantive amendments this floor then will more difficult support bill even that bill step forward pass bill that strengthens the tarp program but insufficiently will then introduce legislation deal with the issues that ive brought this speech and will hopefully one way another pass even stronger restrictions than those that are currently outlined the web page the financial services committee hopefully part the one bill will consider next week possibly part other legislation that will considered before the day when authorize when vote whether disapprove the disbursement the second billion look forward improving the tarp bill think course the greatest improvement that far less skeptical the incoming administration than the outgoing administration and that high skepticism the current administration justified the fact that not one penny has been spent yet paulson anything that told that would spend all the money certain degree skepticism the current treasury secretary has been borne out his remarkable departure from that which was very clear was his promise this house right until the minute when passed the bill that wanted finally lets take look the stimulus bill just want comment few the tax provisions one those that being put forward the administration that think number those including senator kerry have some concerns with the idea providing employers with perhire tax credit for each new person they hire let illustrate the concern have with this proposal imagine two restaurants one has been there for years and desperately trying hold desperately trying keep its staff members employed then somebody else opens new restaurant right across the street its going hire new people well under the provision understand itand there legislative language yet available although the bill will probably voted within few weeksthe new restaurant gets huge credit receives for every one its employees thereby putting position put out business the existing restaurant across the street now there are some tax provisions being suggested the transition team that think make lot sense these involve giving businesses tax deductions that they were otherwise going reap anyway the chief reason support these provisions they give lot bang for the buck they put lot money the hands businesses today but when you look the federal deficit over the next years they increase that federal deficit only little bit why that because the money were giving these businesses today money theyre going owe future years were not giving them new tax deductions were simply letting them take the tax deductions sooner two provisions particularly meet this standard one allowing operating loss carrybacks for years rather than for years allowing those with operating loss deductions used now give money the companies now but deprive the companies those deductions future years second what called accelerated sometimes called bonus depreciation where allow small companies write off new investment immediately rather than taking depreciation deductions over number years another element that ought part the stimulus package aid states and localities there nothing worse the middle deep recession than fire bunch police officers and bunch teachers first that means their work not being done our kids arent being educated and the worst possible time our neighborhoods are less safe second has immediate negative effect employment and the cash available consumers ought providing enough aid all the states make sure that they can anything increase employment those areas public employment that are truly useful their citizens what may need also provide some formula which can provide the money local governments rather than just the state governments would suggest payments each school district based the number fulltime students and payments whichever entity local government provides police protection based the number residents they are protecting want thank this house for giving hour time express these views even with all this time ive said have not presented all the evidence support these positions thats why hope colleagues will visit bradsherman house gov look the additional arguments favor these positions yield back the chair israel
madam speaker the most fundamental purpose for any government its national defense and the protection its citizens stand here today heartfelt support for israel and for its right defend its innocent citizens from the attacks relentless enemy that seeks its destruction the conflict unfolding israels heartland today not unfamiliar the israeli people since its establishment the tiny state israel which would fit into our state californiahas faced enemies every side that openly oppose its right exist and work actively bring about its destruction indeed israel has never known reality where its very existence was not threatened this insidious ideology called jihad ideology sinister make men and women leap for joy killing their own children order able kill the children others whether that means flying commercial airplanes into the world trade center sending qassam rocket into the side bus carrying small school children israel madam speaker imperial china there was terrible form execution known death thousand cuts was unspeakably cruel demonstration meant terrify observers into submissions israel fighting stop the death thousand cuts strategy used hamas inflict constant incessant destruction and terror the israeli citizens and the nation israel has acted nobly for the sake innocent israelis well innocent palestinian civilians justly refuse allow the bloodletting continue hamas was designated foreign terrorist organization the united states and known proxy the iranian regime which openly seeks see israel wiped from the face the earth the governing charter hamas openly calls for the destruction the state israel with the goal raising the banner jihad over every square inch the state israel and still madam speaker time after time israel has acted good faith and has extended gestures goodwill towards its palestinian neighbors and hamas including its complete disengagement from the gaza strip and its commitment target only military installations its enemies despite the routine attacks against its own women and children almost daily basis madam speaker all its conflicts israel seeks minimize civilian casualties hamas has sought maximize them hamas has broken every ceasefire agreement and every honorable rule war deliberately embedding their terrorist militants and weapons caches the homes private citizens and schools and hospitals and mosques and hamas has repeatedly used innocent palestinian civilians human shields while they deliberately target israeli civilians there moral equivalence here madam speaker hamas and israel are guided two completely opposite philosophies one committed equality and human dignity under god and one committed totalitarian ideology hatred and intolerance one devoted protecting innocent human life and one commands its destruction when ceasefire agreement was reached between israel and hamas last june hamas used opportunity build its stockpiles rockets and weapons that now threaten approximately one million israelis and now madam speaker struggle for peace and survival israel once again forced carry out defensive action against hamas order stop the terrorizing its innocent civilians and once again once again madam speaker certain members the international community are calling israel exercise restraint madam speaker rockets had fallen american city over space four years what would say anyone who called upon restrain ourselves the effort protect our own citizens those same members the international community who harshly criticize israel for the defensive actions had suffer for weekjust weekunder these indiscriminate incessant attacks against their families and their loved ones israel has done for decades madam speaker would submit that the layers hamas would have been made ashes once and for all long ago madam speaker charles krauthammer recently wrote the washington post something wish every world leader could understand said some geopolitical conflicts are morally complicated the israeligaza war not possesses moral clarity not only rare but excruciating madam speaker could not agreewith those words more the beleaguered jewish people have learned anything their struggles for survival over the millennia against enemies who have sought their complete annihilation one holocaust survivor said when someone says they intend kill you believe them madam speaker consider some the things that terrorist enemies israel have said they intend israel sheikh hassan nasrallah stated have discovered how hit the jews where they are most vulnerable the jews love life that what shall take from them will win because the jews love life and love death wael alzarad hamas cleric said muslims our blood vengeance against them will only subside with their annihilation and egyptian cleric safwat higazi gave this mandate jihadists hamas television said say you dispatch those sons apes and pigs the hellfire the wings the qassam rockets jihad our path this our strategic option and not peace they the jews deserve killed they deserve die you should not care you hit man woman child destroy everything madam speaker those are horrifying words even when hear them here the safe enclaves our own homes and work places america but for the people israel such words mean terror and death madam speaker americas enemies and israels enemies this war are the same both face the reality radical islamic jihadists who would see our nations wiped from the face the earth they could both our nations have been struck deeply and israel its case has been repeatedly any stretch imagination has been struck this same ideology time and time again the same ideology that murdered olympic athletes that took american hostages iran that murdered marines their barracks that bombed the world trade center that bombed riyadh the khobar towers the embassy the uss cole and then madam speaker this murderous hellish ideology massacred nearly americans september and this enemy makes little distinction between those who support israel and israel itself and for that reason madam speaker must realize that attack israel attack america and freedom itself listefi the words sheikh ahmad bahr acting speaker the palestinian legislative council said allah willing america and israel will annihilated kill them all down the very last one madam speaker any policy the united nations the united states must articulate three concepts prerequisites reached any agreements reached between israel and hamas first must reject any moral equivalence between the goals hamas and israel secondly must place the blame for this current conflict squarely the shoulders hamas and third must clearly restate that americas commitment the state israel remains unshakable stand with israel not republicans madam speaker not democrats but americans and fellow members the human family equal heirs those unalienable gifts god call life liberty and the pursuit happiness these basic human freedoms stand with the innocent people israel who have been terrorized daily basis some for long they can remember and also madam speaker stand with those courageous palestinian souls who also long for freedom and peace with their israeli neighbors madam speaker president harry truman who formally recognized the state israel only minutes after israel had declared its independence said had faith israel before was established have faith now believe has glorious future before itnot just another sovereign nation but embodiment the great ideals our civilization madam speaker recognize those words true and believe that the cause liberty will prevail the land israel has many times before and that israel indeed does have glorious future before throughout its history the hand god has been upon israel and today join the solidarity with the state israel and its people with the innocent palestinians and with all who love peace and pray for the peace jerusalem thank you madam speaker

president presidentelect obama gave powerful and visionary speech last thursday the federal governments role creating shortterm jobs and making longterm investments for future jobs successful that short and longterm investment program must include programs revitalize the american manufacturing sector many have urged the implementation national manufacturing policy for years without success during the bush yearsyears neglect this vital sector our economy that saw our nation lose million manufacturing jobs american manufacturing initiative requires true government partnership with the private sectora partnership that recognizes that our companies are not competing with companies overseas but instead competing with countries whose governments support manufacturing prime example that support the area advanced technology vehicles and advanced batteries the presidentelect said last thursday that must spark the creation clean energy economy said further that will put americans work new jobs including constructing fuel efficient cars investing green energy technologies will provide double benefit job creation and reduction wind and solar are repeatedly cited the prime targets for such investment and they should but there another important technology that not mentioned that should the top the list and that batteries the production future green vehicles the united states will involve significant number green manufacturing jobs and because transportation one the greatest sources major shift these vehicles will result significant reduction greenhouse gas emissions such shift from our current gasolinepowered light duty fleet cars and suvs electric drive vehicles such hybrid electric plugin hybrids and allelectric vehicles would cut our liquid fuel consumption percent significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions but while descriptions economic recovery programs far talk tax credits for purchase such vehicles what missing date commitment fund grants for development and production the batteries that will likely determine whether these vehicles are ultimately made the because the heart these green cars will their batteries the nation makes serious push toward greater use hybrid electric plugin hybrid vehicles and allelectric vehicles there will increasing demand for the advanced batteries that will power these vehicles must ensure that can meet the demand for production these batteries here the the upcoming economic recovery package needs devote minimum billion grants support advanced battery production the united states the lithium ion battery the heart that effort while most the technology was first invented the nearly all those batteries currently produced come from pacific rim countries result years financial support from their governments one may ask why need additional funds for grants for advanced battery development and manufacturing when the congress has already provided funding for loans for the retooling facilities produce advanced technology vehicles and has provided funding for loan guarantees for advanced energy technologies the answer that need grant funding now jump start development manufacturing base for advanced batteries before all their production goes off shore loans and loan guarantees can important provided they are not just authorized but funded but they cannot match grants other countries offer took step this direction sections and the energy independence and security act when congress authorized grants for advanced battery development grants for conversion domestic manufacturing capability produce advanced technology vehicle components and grants for retooling facilities produce advanced technology vehicles but faltered because failed appropriate funds for the programs had authorized these grant programs that must now fund spur and assure that the production the advanced batteries that are the heart green cars will here the the country region that controls and dominates the production batteries will also ultimately control green vehicle production example this already occurring today the where production the americanmade ford escape hybrid limited because toyota controls the production batteries and therefore the number batteries provided for the ford escape are critical juncture the commercialization advanced battery technology even deliberate economic recovery bill vehicle manufacturers are moving toward decisions where purchase the next generation batteries battery manufacturers are this moment assessing the battery production options the and other countries hope for robust economic recovery the industrial sector requires develop advanced batteries here the cannot afford lose their development and production other countries that are willing offer greater financial incentives than are offer loans while other countries offer grants could lose the battle for green vehicle production other countries not because they produce more efficiently cheaply produce better quality but because they are willing offer attractive incentives such grants have the technology and ingenuity and infrastructure build thriving green manufacturing sector that can create millions jobs here america but will require significant government support match the support other countries offer fail provide major grants for advanced battery development and production will not only fail area immediate and significant job creation will also end substituting dependency different form imported energybatteriesfor our current dependency foreign oil cannot overstate the critical urgency this matter and will continue press this matter the days ahead thank senator bingaman and others for the time and yield the floor
president appreciate the cooperation and willingness work with the senator from new mexico has been gentleman throughout have always had conversations just havent agreed what have done has been pleasure work with him here page bill people are going say lot this has been around for long time that doesnt need any debate that certainly should not amended but pages the cbo has refused score this

ability amend since july save one time september the minority has not been allowed offer amendment any bill days have had one amendment amendments could offered was announced that cloture would filed prior even this vote that are going cut off debate could have finished this bill last friday with four five amendments offered amendments and the thought was that shouldnt concern there reason hope for change lot colleagues side the aisle have things that are important them the bill the question the american people ought asking with bills pages now the time for set motion take additional million acres out energy production and limit energy exposure about million more acres and raise the total number wilderness acres million greater than that have total development the country how long ago was had agallon gasoline not think that going come back process grounds for the ability amend least have vote amendment see whether think ought long range our thinking have doubt presidentelect obama wants see change wants see change here has given our country renewed hope but the first thing out the box will our same old habits for good portion this bill there nothing wrong the chairman knows there are large number bills this bill which not have any objection but certainly have some objection tying our hand behind our back energy the future which will tremendous ways colleagues from wyoming and their plans for protecting very pristine wild area want good thing but can done better and still preserve tremendous amounts oil and natural gas this country are here today for the first time years new weekend first sessionthe first time years and are going use force through page billion bill with million mandatory spendingat minimum because did not score past that going about billion total above thatwithout single amendment being allowed debate and vote said has been days since the last amendment days since the last two amendments the minority has been allowed offer amendment bill when you count republican and democratic senators throughout the country you have million people represented republicans yet they are shut off from having amendment the floor the senatethe greatest deliberative body the worldfrom having the ability amend that not change the other problem our priorities are wrong presently have billion backlog our national parks they are hurting the backlog since this time last year has grown million with this bill are going load down the national park service with spending administrative fees doing all sorts important things the clinton birthplace one which today run through private funds are going ask the american taxpayer now pay for are going spend million help augustine have birthday party years from now that cannot our priority cannot but what have done have put together bill can build broad basis consensus pass with everybody holding their nose everything except their own thing everybody would admit this not priority for this country this time matter fact were really doing what should doing should working getting out the economic mess are rather than creating additional barriers and consequences from the actions are going take with this bill when you think about the national parks and you think about the visitor center hawaii with the uss arizona that sinkingand couple years are not even going able honor that tremendous site because not have and will not have put the funds there take care the problemshow that priority president americans died the uss arizona and the senate sits today spend billion large number things that are not priority and not have anything with the heritage sacrifice that proudly and visibly demonstrated that memorial the grand canyon national park has million backlog trails are closed because cannot maintain them the national mall this very city has million backlog maintenance without even considering those things and putting them priorityone the things love about barack obama gets that you have the longterm things and you have have priority and you have transparent you about that the american people can make judgement yet without single effort prioritize spending honor commitment our national resources are about add the burden new heritage areas new units the national park service studies create and expand more national park service wilderness designations which are additional million acres federal landthe federal government owns million acres right now the largest expansion wilderness areas the last years wild and scenic river designations affecting miles shoreline and every one those designations will markedly impact our attempts some sort energy independence you cannot deny that will have impact will have impact will make much more difficult even with clean technology and even with alternative energy bring that energy the american people another significant component this bill massively threatens property rights this country over different property rights organizations are opposition this bill and for good reason because even though several the bills here prohibit the use eminent domain the vast majority them not and several recommend that eminent domain used accomplish their purpose the government owns out acres the and out acres the west eminent domain whether from wilderness areas heritage areas national wild and scenic rivers national trails will have major impact anybody living close somewhat proximity any these new designations because fact they are impacted even outside testimony before the energy committee was stated the park service and several others that fact they will use that lessen the effect and impact these new designations let outline some the other authorizations are making this bill know colleagues disagree with authorizing versus what they mean appropriations but the fact you read the press releases members this body when authorize they tell the people home are going spend are going estimate billion for water project california that years old that will never accomplish what supposed and will have major impact agricultural entities and impact over billion worth commerce billion commerceand that billion just the start annual mandatory expenditures the future there millionand know the acting president pro tempore very interested this but have ask the questionto create way limit the impact wolves our cattle ranchers montana wyoming and idaho created that priority for right now compensate ranchers who lose cattle wild wolves should that where are spending our money right now especially when everybody will agree the end this next year full accounting the end the next fiscal year are going close trillion deficit should annually spend that money should create another federal program that going dole out moneynot that maybe should not that but now the time now the time put the row saying here where are going spend our money there study whether alexander hamiltons boyhood home saint croix virgin islands should designated new national park should spend that money now once authorize that that going come through the national park service and they are going expend the money they are going what congress tells them there million for new garden for our arboretum make sure have taken care orchids should probably that some point time but now the time that have environmental groups that think should not challenge this road through the wilderness alaska one city when already have alternate method transportation yet are going that this bill because have put together everybody holds their nose and votes are going authorize the expenditure money discover old shipwrecks should doing that now that priority for the congress and the country the condition which find ourselves believe many things this bill this pages ought but you went through and polled the average american everything this bill what they would say probably not worth for get what state wants and give all these other things are going lose million barrels proven oil reserves there question about that the data used the geological survey old data they admitted old data are going lose energy the access are going lose the ability access future energy reserves but most all what are going are going disappoint the american people because things have not changed what priority for here terms political benefit home going trump doing what the best interest the longterm interest the country reserve the remainder time
presiden today will vote invoke cloture the motion proceed that can debate amend and consider the omnibus public lands management act hope that colleagues and will given the chance amend this bill have reservations about supporting its final passage its current form while appreciate the chairmans efforts make improvements intend cosponsor amendment strike troublesome provision that would authorize the transfer federal land the izembek national wildlife refugea designated wilderness area and internationally recognized ramsar siteso that road could built the road purportedly allow travel between two alaskan communities cases medical emergencies however congress has already appropriated more than million provide hovercraft which told crosses cold bay about minutes and date has met every medical evacuation need all weather conditionsover the road the other hand would need avoid the numerous ponds and priority wetland areas taking one two hours driveand would not provide safer faster more costeffective transportation than the hovercraft also troubled the addition provision that has been considered neither the house nor the senate energy and natural resources committee prerequisite for all the other public lands bills the package the washington county provision was airdropped into this legislation unfortunate that the wilderness designations the provision fall well short the wildernessquality land the county that should protected this public lands bill only proposes designate percent what included the americas red rock wilderness act which have been pleased join senator durbin supporting furthermore this public lands package omits wilderness unit dry creek that senator bennett has previously agreed protect his washington county growth and conservation act this bill certainly has many good provisions but hope can work improve this important piece legislation
president would like thank senators bingaman domenici and murkowski for their excellent leadership putting together this package and senator reid for his commitment seeking its passage the floor would just like say few words about three wilderness bills the package the california desert and mountain heritage act the sequoiakings canyon national park wilderness act and the eastern sierra and northern san gabriel wild heritage act but first since the economy all our minds right now just want talk little about the economic importance these wilderness areas the outdoor industry foundation estimates that outdoor recreation contributes billion per year the united states economy and supports nearly million jobs recreation specifically wilderness areas produces least million annually according report colorado state university resource economists the economic benefit wilderness areas extends far beyond these types direct uses people are drawn living areas with scenic beauty opportunities for recreation and high quality life bringing new jobs and consumer spending rural counties articles the journals population and environment and the international journal wilderness have documented that population growth increases employment and wage increases rural counties the western united states are all significantly correlated with the percent wilderness land these counties and property values are almost percent higher locations adjacent wilderness when you include indirect economic benefits and ecosystem services such protecting watersheds filtering waste wilderness areas produce staggering billion per year colleagues let clearprotecting wilderness does not hurt our economyit investment into our future now want tell you little about each three wilderness bills and why important that pass them part this package these are bipartisan bicameral bills that will preserve some californias and the nations most magnificent places for generations come have worked with senator feinstein and our colleagues the house each these bills for over years finding the right balance for the conservation development and recreational needs these areas the california desert and mountain heritage act written with representative mary bono mack protects some the last wild places riverside countyone the fastestgrowing counties california bill creates four new wilderness areas

the living former presidents who had all had lunch together and was thinking the majority leader was speaking are rather limited fraternity tooso far fraternity will sorority some point well

term the senate certainly privileged kentucky has sent the senate five times now speak for them and for their interests and intend work harder than ever have over the next years justify their confidence such time this after the people kentucky have spoken cannot help but think great kentuckians the past who the people state have selected represent their interests some know from the history books such henry clay although was speaker the house secretary state and threetime presidential candidate know him best the senator from kentuckythe great compromiser who staved off civil war take john breckinridge elected congress from virginia resigned that seat move kentucky which the time was americas western frontier key architect kentuckys early state government breckinridge went serve senator from kentucky and then our young nations attorney general under thomas jefferson moving modern times can think other legendary senators from kentucky whose footsteps still echo these halls kentucky still fondly remembers the career public service carved out chandler would the first tell you made his mark not senator but twoterm governor the job resigned the senate hold commissioner baseball matter what the job with his winning personality was better known throughout the state his nickname happy sure would happy see his grandson congressman ben chandler continuing his familys tradition service the people kentucky have also spoken this floor before admiration and respect for john sherman cooper the conscience the senate his day will always remember the man who mentored intern first job capitol hill and helped navigate these hallways decades later freshman senator course there alben barkley the first and until recently the only kentuckian elected his partys leader after years leading senate democrats through the great depression and world war became americas vice president alben barkley held the record kentuckys longest serving senator for over yearsuntil was broken man who like him rose from humble beginnings become famous across the commonwealth that senator was wendell ford man many colleagues have had the honor know and work alongside wendell was the senior senator from state when was first elected and got watch him close for years over those years learned why wendell the first and only kentuckian elected successively lieutenant governor governor and senator because even while attained high office never forgot the lessons learned working alongside his parents their farm countless times reminded voters was just country boy from yellow creek and kentuckians respected him for proving that country boy could walk the halls power dine with kings and presidents and still come back yellow creek and right home wendell hampton ford was born daviess county and grew his familys acre farm the little town thruston the ford family raised cattle hogs and chickens and grew tobacco and corn young wendell was stranger work did his part milking cows hand twice day every day decades later whenever anyone told him had strong handshake wendell would tell them milked early age know wendell would credit his parents with teaching him everything needed know succeed life ernest ford was farmer insurance company owner and chairman the daviess county democratic party served both the kentucky state house and senate his mother irene ford worked harder than anyone the family farm she picked strawberries she snapped green beans and she canned everything that you could can she could cook pork tenderloin that was good wendell recalls wed say itd make you swallow your tongue she was devoted her family her friends her neighbors and her church wendell remembers mother never disliked anyone she never would say anything unkind about anybody and mother worked very very hard theres anyone that ever went heaven mother there now going guess that maybe through his athers political connections wendell scored plum prize young child became page the kentucky state house the way they inducted pages back then little different from how the senate today wendells sponsor representative from taylorsville had young wendell come and stand his desk the house floor gave speech about what good little kid was and when was done the entire chamber applauded making wendell page acclamation after introduction politics like that any wonder wendell decided wanted more wendell was also lucky enough meet one the great kentuckians mentioned earlieralben barkleyback when obviously senator ford was young the seelbach hotel hometown louisville heard speech from the senator and future vice president like barkley wendell always wanted around peoplea trait that would serve him well public servant like most kentuckians wendell ford loves basketball played the basketball team for thruston elementary school and played the team for daviess county high school but while high school wendell broke his arm that ended his basketball career and that threatened end his involvement with the team the friendships had made and his seat the bus all the away games stay involved wendell filled open slot the schools cheerleading team got keep going the games got keep his friendships and ended being voted most talkative the daviess county high school senior class after high school graduation wendell attended the university kentucky then was drafted into the army and sgt wendell ford reported for duty fort hood but was not the only ford trade his bluegrass for gallon hat and make that trip his side was his lovely bride jean who met wendell when they both worked the penney store owensboro the summer after wendells high school graduation they married september just after wendell had turned jean hailed from the town west point hardin county she could hardly have known then how her life would turn out how she and her husband would become respected across the commonwealth oftentimes colleagues and will talk about our wives our husbands and what will doing over the next recess you will frequently hear spouses first names tossed around like wifes name elaine but after years marriage wendell only referred his bride mrs ford testament the fact that the country boy from yellow creek remains forever country gentleman after the end world war and honorable discharge from the service wendell graduated from the maryland school insurance and jean returned owensboro where his family had moved after selling the farm wendell entered the insurance business with his father and started take interest what was happening his community all started with razor that what wendell was looking buy lunchtime errand when ran into friend who invited him jaycees luncheon travels across kentucky have met many who know and remember wendell from his days with the jaycees devoted fostering leadership and community service the jaycees have done lot for kentucky and for the nation once again the man who played role that cannot ignored wendell ford lot beliefs that would come characterize wendell fords career came from the creed the jaycees that creed states that only faith god gives meaning and purpose human life that government should laws rather than men and that service humanity the best work life wendell would rise rapidly his career again and again matter what the arena and his time the jaycees was different that first meeting the request friend led wendell becoming member was the kentucky jaycees state president led the kentucky jaycees their national convention kansas city with one goal they wanted return home with kentuckian the organizations national presidenta kentuckian named wendell ford kentucky has rich history colorful memorable campaign ads but took wendell ford candidate for the jaycees national president come with brilliant piggybacking his name perhaps the most famous rockandroll song all time conventions end every jaycee delegate went home singing familiar tune with the words shake rattle and roll replaced with shake rally with ford wendell remembers kept them all night with that record and guess made even better because won work the crowds the convention wendell bought two new suits for apiece one black and one gray rotating jackets with each pair pants had four different outfits for the days the convention whether was the song the suits both wendell went home the first jaycees national president from kentucky and his network from that organization became the foundation for one the commonwealths most successful political careers the late wendell had caught the eye bert combs who had run for governor kentucky but lost happy chandler combs was planning run again and wanted the impressive jaycees president the youth chairman his campaign after winning that race bert combs made wendell his administrative assistant job held from but soon the time came for wendell emerge from the ranks political staffers and run for office himself ran for state senate seat representing daviess and hancock counties and clearly was not afraid challenging race the reason say was not afraid challenging race the guy ran against the primary fellow named cap gardner was not just any incumbent senator was the state senate majority leader was law school the university kentucky the time and remember reading about the primary which the majority leader the kentucky state senate was upset impressive young man named wendell ford won that race votesafter recount those days kentucky was very much oneparty state winning the democratic primary for most any office was tantamount winning the election most counties you could hold republican party meetings phone booth not that way anymore which think for the betteri think competitive twoparty system makes both parties better and that turn serves the people bestbut the democratic party ruled kentucky then and after wendell won the primary easily won the general for the first time but not the last became senator ford freshman senator sponsored bills all which became law that record success few legislators would dare seek duplicate but wendell didnt plan staying the state senate too long just years later ran for lieutenant governor and once again ruffled some feathers amongst the more established politicians the commonwealth who didnt understand why this country boy from yellow creek couldnt settle down and wait his turn the primary wendell faced robert matthews the incumbent state attorney general sure the entrenched political forces kentucky expected and perhaps even desired matthews win but wendell wasnt going along with their program defeated matthews the primarybarely percent percent wendell went win similarly close race the general election defeating thomas ratliff and becoming the lieutenant governor kentucky but the same time something unusual happened you heard say just minute ago that those days kentucky was very much oneparty state but kentuckians elected guy named louie nunn kentuckys first republican governor since world war that time candidates for governor and lieutenant governor state ran separately while the democratic candidate for governor lost wendell ford quite remarkably won and instantly became two things the topranked democrat state government and course real thorn the side governor nunn wendell had beat republican tidea rare tide those daysto become lieutenant governor was clearly man great talent and ambition who was not yet done making his mark kentucky politics naturally looked next the top job state government the office governor that era kentucky governors were forbidden succeed themselves running for second term fact kentucky retained that term limit for governors right until the sone the last states wendell would not have face governor nunn the election would however have face different governor his friend and mentor former governor bert combs everybody kentucky thought governor combs who had subsequently had distinguished career court appeals judge after his term governor was lead pipe cinch the next governor kentucky the very least win the democratic primary for sure but once again wendell ford beat everybodys expectations bert combs resigned his judgeship run for governor and couldnt believe what tough race his former administrative assistant gave him when mutual friend the two candidates said combs that had taught wendell well combs replied yes taught him too damn well wendell beat bert combs percent percent the primary and went easily win the general election december was sworn governor kentucky right from the start governor fords guiding belief kentuckys chief executive was that the only reason for the existence government any level was serve people wherever felt that wasnt happening believed there must change throughout his term bill that governor ford supported failed pass commanded the forces the state government below him the way general commands his troops but governor ford didnt ask anyone else work harder than did himself his work ethic back then was legendary and think some colleagues can attest the fact that kept right after joined here the senate governor hour workday was routine hour day frequent and hour day not uncommon when governor ford used fly here washington for official matters was all business time the car the plane was spent reading memos writing speeches dinner was cheeseburger and fries the hotel room early possible the next morn ing wendell was and flying home kentucky where would put anextralate night the state capitol make for time missed once had successfully enacted the major points his platformincluding shrinking and streamlining state government creating the states first environmental protection agency and enacting severance tax coalwendell ford decided was not finished serving the people kentucky just yet have already said that time kentucky governor could not run for second term wendell looked the senate election where would have take incumbent republican senator marlow cook the election came the heels the watergate scandal and richard nixons resignation goes without saying was very hard year for republicans but even had been easy year for republicans governor ford would have been very hard defeat wendell won over marlow cook pretty handily and governor ford became senator ford should point out actually used work for senator cook legislative director the early part his one term senator cook graciously agreed step aside little bit early for senator ford wendells tenure this chamber began december this point the wendell ford many colleagues know and admire emerges spent incredibly successful and fruitful years here after election served alongside him for those years obviously wendell ford and did not stand the same side the aisle but always stood together for the people kentucky with wendell whether you agreed disagreed you always knew where you stood with him even you disagreedwhich often didwendell knew how disagree without being disagreeable remember one joke liked tell about how seriously kentuckians take our horseracing liked say that one day the running the kentucky derby man walking churchill downs noticed box with empty seat stopped and said the little old lady sitting next this the first empty seat have seen today bear mind this the derby she replied well belonged husband but died the man said seems shame let such good seat waste why didnt you give one your relatives the lady said would have but they are all the funeral that how important the derby and the horse industry are the bluegrass state wendell ford enjoyed telling that story with his sense humor penchant for storytelling that rivaled his childhood hero alben barkley and his abil ity establish friendships and trust wendell quickly became leader amongst his senate colleagues served stint running the democratic senatorial campaign committee had risen become chairman the senate rules committee that position put him charge the inaugural ceremonies the capitol for both presidents george bush and bill clinton kentuckians were proud see one their own the inaugural platform just footsteps away from the new president wendell was chairman the joint committee printing where worked trim the costs government printing and implemented the first ever program for the use recycled printing paper that may not the type issue that grabs the biggest headlines but obviously official washington uses lot paper wendell was ahead his time making these environmentally friendly efforts that are commonplace now and saved taxpayers millions dollars wendell could see the absurdity some what goes washington and knew just when break the tension with little humor one former colleague has spoken one the many times the senate has continued session until oclock the morning with debate still going the senate floor one these times wendell nudged the senator next him and said you know the people back home think that are the ones who won wendell even appeared once the cable channel mtv program called rock the vote because his sponsorship the motor voter law that mtv appearance made him very popular with his grandchildren surely the number senators who have appeared sandwiched between videos for whitney houston and billy ray cyrus very small wendells colleagues friend the majority leader pointed out elected him their party the senate the senate whip held that slot until his retirement wendell was elected acclamation and without opposition that obviously position great responsibility and honor and speaks the respect wendell commanded from his fellow senators after his election whip said kentucky are known for our horses plan being workhorse and not show horse think knowing wendells work ethic one doubted would give his all the job march wendell became the longest serving senator kentucky history breaking the record the man had seen giving speech more than years earlier alben barkley that just another accomplishment long list that has amassed over his extraordinarily successful tenure both state and federal government wendell ford served this body for days record that stood for nearly years until january this past saturday never lost election for public office kentucky sent him the senate four times and was the first statewide candidate carry all counties how does country boy from yellow creek achieve such success the highest levels american politics think because matter where ended wendell ford never forgot from where started from even his final months the senate still got goose bumps every time looked the capitol dome his way work remained the same man partial cigarette and downhome tale when his duties didnt require him washington would return home kentucky did most weekends throughout his senate career day weekend was perfect chance the house and his family owned rough river lake and some reading and fishing once said his idea vacation was not shaving and not wearing suit wendell ford never forgot the truly important things his lifehis wife jean their children and grandchildren and the simple pleasures his native kentucky many colleagues will remember his trademark greeting when walked into room would say how are all you lucky people doing sometimes that would shortened simply hey lucky but wendell never lost sight that was truly the lucky one for receiving the trust the people kentucky many times over would the first tell you that and kentucky and our nation are lucky well for having had his many years service over the next years work hardest better the lives everyone kentucky and the country going remember the lessons learned from wendell fords long career will remember how his life testament the success anybody america can attain even country boy from yellow

with energy determination and principle being the senator from kentucky the best job could ever hope have president yield the floor
president those who have been listening and watching for the last few minutes got one good lesson why senator mcconnell has been here for over years this day honor him but spent virtually all his time honoring someone else remarkable and rare event that senator mcconnell could serve longer than wendell ford the man just honored longer than henry clay longer than john sherman cooper and longer than alben barkley but all know longevity itself not transcending virtue but indication one the most transcending virtues and that the people kentucky for the last years have seen something special mitch mcconnell something that good for kentucky the opinion kentuckians and something that good for our country have seen that too but for longer period time than years years exact remember when mitch mcconnell came washington not the time was intern but the legislative director for senator marlow cook legislative director little bit puffedup title for the job that time because the office senator baker tennessee where had been the year before there was only one legislative assistant were legislative directors usually one two people time which may seem pretty hard for staff members this senate understand remember that moved over work for bryce harlow the nixon white house howard baker who had been good friend marlow cook the new senator from kentucky came and said marlow cook has bright young man working for him you ought get know him did years ago both stayed washington for while both went home after few years and years ago both were elected executive position our home statesi governor tennessee and mitch mcconnell the county executive jefferson county which louisville the big county there then the record shows and all know was elected the senate the only republican the country that year believe who was able defeat incumbent democrat when senator mcconnell and were young staff assistants the senate the leaders the senate were senators dirksen and mansfield there have been many great leaders the senate since that period time all those leaders who were goodand most them wereknew this body knew the senate they knew human nature instinctively but they had one other quality and this another quality senator mcconnell has they had great respect for our country last july brought onto the senate floor group teachers history they were selected one from each state under program that called presidential academies for teachers united states history since senator may bring onto the floor before convenes anybody chooses there were here showed them daniel websters desk which right next talked with them about henry clay and showed them jefferson daviss desk the back you can imagine these outstanding teachers were awestruck being the floor the senate they were the only ones here after about minute visit one themi think was the teacher from oregonsaid senator alexander what would you like for take back our students about this visit found myself saying hope you will tell them that get every morningand think most here doand come work hoping that the end the day can make this country little better place not sure what looks like television not sure what looks like the front pages the newspapers but that motive and that the motive most here that has been the motive senator mitch mcconnell kentucky yes beginning his year the senate rare distinction especially because from state that has produced many outstanding senators and state that even today and through most the last years has been very competitive state with democrats and republicans both having chance elected mitch mcconnell gets every day comes into workand usually very earlythinking about how make this country little better before the end the dayand that usually very late that quality even more important than his more than years service president yield the floor
president thank dear friend from tennessee for being the senate floor today and for his overly kind comments about tenure have indeed been friends for years

president was somewhat shocked last october when the vote came and actually senators the senate and about percent the house representatives voted give unelected bureaucrat billion with wanted with accountability believe that years from now historians will look back and say that was the most outrageous vote maybe the history these institutions the administration has now requested the second billion sometime this week you are reasonable person and were assume that major event the financial world has prompted the negotiations that led the decision release the second billion you would wrong the true reason congress may asked release the second billionit just politics hot potato nobody wants but they all want the money and that what are faced with now again event the financial world has prompted the request for the second billion was critical the bush administration and particularly secretary paulson since the october vote giving paulson unelected bureaucrat billion with wished hard for and hard for most americans understand when they talk about these huge numbersbillion dollars and trillion dollars whatever means but think the time has come count the actual number families who file tax returns america and you your math with your billion comes family that what are talking about this not little deal huge think people look some the things that have happened since then the fault passing the billion bill that precipitated all the problems have congress asked institution prepare say yes the next billion deficit spending simply because received letter assurances not know what letters assurance are what letter assurance but suppose the same kind assurance got from secretary paulson when said have have billion and has used buy damaged assets the letters assurances are bunch promises paper and that not sufficient justification for this institution let the billion taxpayers money congress needs put itself back the process when are talking about this kind money that why introduced legislation with bipartisan group senators that says the executive branch can only have access the remaining billion congress approves the submitted plan and votes that plan what bad about that this the way have been doing business for years and years the administration will make request that what they the budget process comes congress evaluate that and determine whether who are elected representatives believe something that should take place have already seen the legislation passed last fall blank check for one person whatever wants with billions dollars take for instance the auto bailout the interesting thing about the auto bailout everyone expressed all this outrage over the auto bailout said back october when percent the members the house and the senate voted give secretary paulson billion with wished who going next line bailed out suggested aviation then the auto industry and farmers and everybody else that exactly what did happen those people who expressed such outrage with the auto bailout should stop and realize had not been for that vote turn loose and turn over billion that could not have happened people talk about whatever was billion whatever was the auto bailout that only constituted percent the billion that what have keep our minds what precipitated the problem have now were told what was going done with the money paulson came september and said didnt immediately come through with billionthat what said would take buy bad assetsthe total economy would collapse was panic scenario then the plans changed and paulson beganand this happened right after got his hands the billion didnt use buy damaged assets used pass out various financial institutionsbanks belief the rationale for releasing any more the billion longer applies matter fact prominent economist from the reagan administration last wednesday said the first billion did absolutely good terms dealing with the recession are currently was clear the time was mistake sign blank check one man for such tremendous amount money although there are still significant challenges the financial markets appears the threat the financial crisis spinning out control that face another great depressionwhich was the original justification for the grant such sweeping authorityhas subsided has the need allow one person whether secretary paulson timothy geithner give away hundreds billions taxpayers dollars banks subsided well that question that needs asked and that answer yes fully understand the severity the ongoing financial crisis that erupted this past year fully aware the need take extraordinary actions such situations from the rescue bear stearns march the announcement the bank equity purchase program midoctober two bailouts for aig hundreds billions extended citigroup the government has indeed undertaken extraordinary efforts calm financial markets however clear and many colleagues that the treasury accessing the remaining billion would little fix the recession are now time for the government cease announcements new programs plans designed inject confidence markets moreover think confidence would better instilled halting the announcement new billion dollar programs designed fix markets understand the need move accordance with changing conditions simply think the time has come stop having the government trying fix markets the markets are going have fix themselves that going take some time not going pleasant process but are fooling ourselves think can come with some easy shortcut solving these problems one the major causes this crisis was the accumulation far too much debt the part some financial institutions the government can make the same mistake are now anticipating astounding trillion deficit this year alone and that before any accounting the roughly billion stimulus proposal can remember many people this body criticizing president bush his deficits you take the total deficits the bush administration and add them and divide the years has been there the average billion now are looking trillion this massive debt accumulation poses serious threat future stability and economic growth are track have budget deficit this year that exceeds the size the entire federal budget only few years ago however can immediately make progress reducing that deficit amount not releasing the billion that something that deserves sufficient debate finally fiscal conservative the thing that concerns about the billion bailout permanently changed the perception about what big big government from now what another billion here another billion there after give billion banks what the big deal about trillion dollar deficit billion stimulus package multibillion health care proposal whatever plan dreamed around here spend the taxpayer money once gave billion unelected bureaucrat with oversight have simply lost our perspective people now think that the amount has changed will close noting the cost the following defining events the century much our shared history and compare them with the billion bailout hopefully bring little perspective the debate over the request for the second half the billion bailout the marshall plan was long time ago but you bring uptodate that would amount billion this after inflation the race the moon billion the entire korean war billion the new deal billion the vietnam war billion and then years iraq the liberation iraqpeople were complaining about how much money costit less than the billion are talking about here cannot put fast track the remaining billion this package congress going have actively debate any further funding what legislation does first all not anything all sit back and act like everything fine and wait until the proposal comes then the only thing can under the law passed october this past year have resolution disapproval the leadership senator reid and the leadership decide should not have vote that sure they will have procedural ways have this kept from having vote but even there vote they would have that control that doesnt any good all the only way pass this bill that says cannot spend the last billion until they come forth with program evaluate take our prerogative given the constitution and determine whether this wise expenditure these funds hope will have several others wanting join who can argue with accountability yield the floor suggest the absence quorum

president last month presidentelect obama designated eric holder the next attorney general the united states when presidentelect obama made this choice there was virtual universal praise from both sides the aisle republican orrin hatch utah the former chair the senate judiciary committee said eric holder was excellent choice his words and that intend support him colleague senator jeff sessions alabama said think his instincts law and order are good and that was disposed support eric holder senator tom coburn oklahoma said think its good choice not hard see why the initial response eric holders selection was positive after all holder had been confirmed unanimously the senate for the position deputy attorney general the person the justice department holder supported broadening the authority independent counsel ken starr difficult decision that was criticized many democrats starrs investigation led the impeachment president clinton and holder recommended the appointment special prosecutor investigate interior secretary bruce babbitt member president clintons cabinet earlier his career eric holder had been appointed president ronald reagan serve judge was later appointed president clinton the attorney washington that position earned reputation for independence prosecuted public officials both political parties during the years served career prosecutor the justice departments public integrity section wonder holders nomination serve attorney general was met initially with strong bipartisan praise unfortunately some senators are now questioning the character eric holder what has happened why the change why the initial positive reaction man who has served prosecutor judge the man the department justice someone who has faced thousands decisions person who was first appointed under republican president then democratic president why this change well attributable part someone who has surfaced again the american political scene and has been very vocal his criticism eric holder that person karl rove sure all recall karl rove used president bushs top political strategist today works highpriced political consultant interview last month rove called eric holder the one controversial nominee among presidentelect obamas cabinet choices washington post reporter who had been covering the holder nomination said interview word the street that karl rove going helping lead the fight against eric holder when his nomination for attorney general heads the senate that unfortunate confident however that the end the day when eric holder comes before the senate judiciary committee this week for his nomination hearing will answer the questions directly and show the senate and the american people that excellent choice our next attorney general met with eric holder office last month had similar meetings with president bushs attorney general nominees michael mukasey alberto gonzales and john ashcroft meetings with all four these nominees asked each them about their views issues that were central the mission the department justice asked them about variety different issues human rights civil rights civil liberties national security and access justice tried take the measure each man and gain sense whether they would have the independence and integrity for the job opinion eric holder stood head and shoulders above the others lets take one example but critically important example the issue torture the late historian arthur schlesinger said this about the torture policy the bush administration position taken has done more damage the american reputation the worldever historian schlesinger course has written about the american history the and centuries and think understood much not more than others that some the graphic scenes and details torture under the bush administration have created unfortunately sad memories among people across the world sadly that policy torture was aided and abetted the last two attorneys general instead defending the rule law the bush administrations justice department set aside our treaty obligations and redefined torture with evasive words and with wink and nod during his confirmation hearings gonzales told was legally permissible for the united states america subject detainees cruel inhuman and degrading treatment but cruel inhuman and degrading treatment are clearly prohibited the torture convention treaty ratified and are bound obey drafted legislation overturn this bush administration policy and make clear that cruel inhuman degrading treatment prohibited all circumstances will tell colleagues that bill did not pass but virtually identical bill introduced senator john mccain which was proud cosponsor did pass overwhelmingly was obvious that senator mccain was the right person carry this issue his experience detainee and prisoner war during the vietnam conflict gave him more credence this issue than anybody else the senate floor stood and spoke not only for the american people but for great tradition american law was criticized and there were objections from vice president cheney and others but senator mccains position prevailed the senate after alberto gonzales departed attorney general under cloud scandal had hoped that the justice department would able turn new page with the nomination michael mukasey had served federal district court judge was accomplished attorney was someone who thought came this job with the capacity put perspective some the most contentious issues during his confirmation hearing the second day asked mukasey simple straightforward question the torture technique known waterboarding legal now waterboarding torture technique that was used long ago the spanish inquisition the century following world war the united states prosecuted japanese military personnel war criminals when they were accused waterboarding prisoners the judge advocates general the highest ranking lawyers the military told and testified unequivocally that waterboarding was illegal but mukasey his confirmation hearing for attorney general refused answer question and this day still refuses acknowledge that waterboarding torture presidentelect barack obama has made clear that will reclaim americas role champion and defender fundamental human rights saidand quote former senate colleague presidentelect obama administration should allow the use torture including socalled enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding headslapping and extreme temperatures its time that had department justice that upholds the rule law and american values instead finding ways enable the president subvert them more political parsing legal loopholes believe eric holder will fulfill the presidentelects commitment when met with holder asked him the same simple question had asked michael mukasey waterboarding illegal without hesitation holder looked straight the eye and saidand quote senator waterboarding torture after hours questioning michael mukasey that simple obvious fact when refused answer straightforwardly here have nominee for attorney general who has made clear that america going return the values have held dear for generations and think returning those values will help restore our position and credence the world indeed holder has spoken out repeatedly about this issuenot just meeting with privately for example last june speech before the american constitution society said our needlessly abusive and unlawful practices the war terror have diminished our standing the world community and made less rather than more safe alberto gonzales the former attorney general said the united states could engage cruel inhuman and degrading treatment listen what eric holder said during his speech the american constitution society must declare without qualification that the law policy and practice the united states government that not torture people and not subject people cruel inhuman degrading treatment what stark contrast from the evasive words heard from alberto gonzales and the refusal attorney general michael mukasey address this issue directly can assure colleagues that eric holder will bring about welcome change the department justice and welcome change that our nation anxious see possesses the experience the wisdom and the integrity outstanding attorney general leader who can rebuild the morale within the justice department and restore faith among the american people this important agency all remember that chapter the history the department justice when many attorneys were unceremoniously dismissed from their positions many whom had never had any criticism leveled them for their professional work questions have been raised over and over whether this was just political move what the fact sure took its toll the morale the department have chance with eric holder restore critical because without faith our system justice our democracy danger wish address one final matter that some republican colleagues have talked about the pardon marc rich the closing days the clinton administration january president clinton issued pardon for marc rich who had been convicted tax evasion and who had fled the country presidents have the power issue pardons and commutations and they seek the advice the justice department which requests grant and which reject january the last full day the clinton presidency the white house called eric holder the justice department ask him his opinion about marc rich without spending much time examining the pardon request eric holder indicated did not oppose retrospect when asked him directly office holder admitted that comment was mistake acknowledged that the rich pardon should not have been granted and that should have sought the input other justice department officials about this recommendation was lapse judgment and holder has openly acknowledged now many who have spoken out the senate floor have occasionally said things wish hadnt said are matter course given permission revise and extend our remarks make mistake but rare public life senators congressmen and occasionally elected officials itto just say flat out made mistake eric holder has been open and honest about that value that the thousands decisions faced the man the justice department there are only handful that have even raised question and has been open and honest saying that this was not the right thing there probably one america more disappointed that pardon marc rich than the man who prosecuted him james comey you may remember comey sure republican who served for few years the deputy attorney general the justice department under john ashcroft was the one who stood president bush and refused authorize the presidents secret surveillance program during the critical period when john ashcroft was hospitalized and comey served briefly the acting attorney general earlier his career assistant attorney new york comey was the prosecutor charge the marc rich case knows the case better than any strongly opposed the pardon marc rich president bill clinton did his colleagues the attorneys office new york however comey sent letter the senate judiciary committee few weeks ago support the nomination eric holder wish read from said have come believe that holders role the rich and codefendant pincus green pardons was huge misjudgmentmr comey wrote the committeeone for which has appropriately paid dearly reputation comey went say yet hope very much confirmed know lot good people who have made significant mistakes think holders may actually make him better steward the department justice because has learned hard lesson about protecting the integrity that great institution from political fixers not suggesting errors judgment are qualification for high office but this case where the nominee smart decent humble man who knows and loves the department and has demonstrated his commitment the rule law across entire career the error should not disqualify him eric holder should confirmed attorney general that statement support from james comey republican and the chief prosecutor marc rich who was entrusted with major responsibilities the department justice under president bush man who knows that department very well comeys opinion also shared larry thompson another prominent republican who served for several years deputy attorney general under president bush thompson had this say about eric holder and the rich pardon theres way you can have highprofile job washington like the deputy attorney general without attracting some kind controversy that matter has been fully investigated and should put behind him let also read the statement another highprofile republican rogers who served two republican white houses rogers said under the constitution the presidents authority pardon unlimited there was deceit malfeasance holder everyone knows this was bill clintons initiative eric holder innocent then added the rich pardon bar eric holder being effective attorney generaleven though republicans and some the media will enjoy rehashing you can question eric holders judgment the marc rich case but you cant question his integrity his independence and his character few days ago the senate judiciary committee received letter support for eric holder from prominent republican lawyers including former attorney general william barr and former chief counsel senator arlen specter pennsylvania michael oneill this what the letter said due his character and experience eric today enjoys the endorsement

president had interesting day yesterday brought lot people work believe unnecessarily adopt motion proceed that could have voted today want spend some time today outlining what our new soon president presidentelect obama said during his campaign and what said personally several times about how fix what wrong with our country you his web site what his transition team has said what you will find are some very significant things that both and have worked over the past years has plan called the obama plan for restoring fiscal discipline good plan what does include includes conducting exhaustive linebyline review federal spending and eliminating government programs that are not performing are wasteful are obsolete are duplicative paying for new spending commitments new spending commitmentsby cutting other programslet say that againpaying for new spending commitments cutting other programs slashing porkbarrel spending rooting out redundancy and requiring all federal contracts over including earmarks competitively bid truly measure program performance without ideologic slant and enforcing goals and demanding that new initiatives selected the basis merit not political process that rewards lobbyists and campaign donors and makes members congress just look good home that presidentelect obama dont know anybody outside washington who would not embrace that message that great message for our country message that our country needs heed one that need accomplish unfortunately the first week are back session are doing exactly the opposite here have presidentelect obama who next week will become president obama and one his main goals are working undermine the senate today going ally the presidentelect these issues every opportunity when are not doing what suggested doing going raising questions about are going work hard for the hope and change promised the american people would deliver have before lands package not really lands package has all sorts stuff bills initially spends billion but that not even honest because after years spends billion billion more one program alone cbo has not even scored this new package the last package they scored appropriated would billion have billion billion new spending the opportunity offer amendments that has been foreclosed thought light what this bill and light what president obama said would like see that would highlight some the amendments would have offered had the minority the republican party the republican members the senate been given opportunity amend this bill the best tradition the senatethe best tradition the senateis where the best ideas get debated the back and forth goes and then settle what almost always compromise but compromise that thoroughly debated and where individual senator has put their stamp yea nay ideas either make better not that not available this bill matter fact hasnt been available for days has been available once republican members the senate days are accomplish least move the direction that our soontobe president would like for one the things that going required for that taking tough votes the idea dont want our members have take tough votes the height inside political baseball and wreaks lack courage senator from oklahoma cant home and defend votes cogent and reasonable manner shouldnt sent back here that all there oklahoma citizens believe have not stood the principles which told them would try represent them this body they should not send back the senate but not have the votes the first place dont have defend anything goes against not just the culture the senate but goes against the very courage that this whole country was based upon and that the freedom express and work and try accomplish what you think best for the country the long run one the great qualities our country this freedom get out and express until recently that freedom has been available the senate but this didnt start with harry reid goes all the way back george mitchell and trent lott and bill frist has been perfected under our current majority leader thought would that maybe ought take the hard votes rather than ruin the institution maybe ought what the american people would expect now intent has never been all proceedings the floor extend debate mean think could accomplish filibuster wanted that having delivered babies know how stay all night goal have the opportunity amendments and have vote them most people know agreements time amendments are easily obtained and limitation amendments are most often very easily obtained the fact find ourselves billion bill that has lots good things and has lots mediocre things that probably would priority didnt find ourselves with trillion deficit this year and getting ready pass billion stimulus package that about per man woman and child this country about per family none which going paid fornone which going paid for will ultimately paid for and here how will paid for when look toward our grandchildren what are going find that not many them get college because they will not able afford when look toward them owning home regardless the housing crisis find ourselves now years from now the ability earn income big enough able afford mortgage going limited because have been poor stewards with their taxpayer money will have shackled our grandchildren let spend minute talking about eliminating wasteful programs things that are not priority and over couple the amendments were going offer simply point out that are doing the opposite what believe the intent our new president going might also add wasnt that long ago that all were paying for gallon gasoline there question mind that good portion that price was because speculation the very rich this country asking the very poor pay out their disposable income while they made millions upon billions dollars manipulating the futures markets but nevertheless this bill are putting patch over our eye and limiting our ability the future increase our energy independence taking millions acres land and forever closing them any source energy would not matter what any new technology might and would not matter could totally without any environmental impact are closing that completely off that set aside one the amendments were going offer this bill was strike million the city augustine now you might ask what for well they are going have birthday party years recognize the year augustines existence the longest colonial outpost this continent would say maybe that might augustine responsibility maybe the state florida but when are running deficit this country per family per year seems ludicrous that would send million for party how does that set with priorities how does that set with eliminating wasteful spending doesnt yet here and dont have the opportunity try take out there million the bill build new facility maryland for orchids for the smithsonian may need that but certainly dont need that right now that luxury item every family this country today making reassessment because everybody afraid and they are going through their budgets and saying what necessary what excess what can without should putting money away case happens everybody the country doing that except the congress here have new orchid building costing million dont remember exactly which that are going put this bill and are going say this priority now some will say well might not appropriate appropriate billion year for things that are not authorized anyway and most those things are not priority well but the fact clue the american public that dont get that this time significant economic downturn this time significant debt laying the next generations continue want things the average person common sense would say how can that priority well cant there million here for new botanical gardens hawaii and florida dont doubt that could great thing that could would ask the question again why isnt that state responsibility instead federal responsibility the state florida and the state hawaii think that priority they ought fund our priority our responsibility that something should funding now that should authorizing should saying okay this are perilous times yet act like nothing going out there that the average family isnt getting hit hard that people arent worried about their jobs that people didnt lose their jobs last month that how are behaving one the other amendments would have offered prohibit the use eminent domain both the national trails the wilderness areas the new heritage areas and the new national parks area one thing for the government have its land totally different for through the force law take your land away from you and tell you what they are going with there minimal prohibition this bill for the protection property rights this countrya fundamental freedom guaranteed every american this bill steps all over those property rights offered total amendments and would have probably accepted with less than hour debate each one them could have been finished with this bill could have accomplished last thursday friday but because dont want have take tough votes want protect member from vote some piece pork that was put bill have decided have votes debate any amendment will the standard for this body not good day for the senate more importantly terrible day for this country because are saying that even though have great hope and promise change incoming president his own party going step thatthe careerists the people who think politically only the people who think short term only about political gain instead thinking about what the best longterm interests our country interesting know have million acres wilderness this country right nowmore than anywhere else the world that number actually greater than the amount developed land have this country which million acres also interesting know the government already owns million acres and are going take minimum another million acres and totally wall offcant ride dirt bike through minimal access cant hunt cant the things you have always done you happen unfortunate enough have property next you fall peril having the national park service fund organizations that are going take your property rights away limit your ability the land you have that abutting these areas come into next week approach the celebration very great milestone our country something that speaks volumes about the american system the installment and swearing the first africanamerican president one who leads these issues while the senate say are going keep doing the way have been doing regardless the tremendous hope that brought the american people the hope for change that would operate differently hope will lead government that operates differentlyand believe will try very dear friend mine believe going try that here sit the senate worrying about the political consequences taking few votes amendments because might not look good enough home talk about the lack courage talk about the decline that will manifested our country continue have leadership that operates the basis fear instead courage challenge and hope that this the last time are going see this tactic brought forward the senate pledge the majority leader will not delay anything get opportunity amend but get opportunity amend will delay everything because the lack opportunity amend says that over half the people this country the million who are represented side the aisle have voice the matter says dont get our voice doesnt count look forward with great hope the leadership are going see the other end pennsylvania avenue prayer that the leadership this body can come the same level character and courage that believe will see demonstrated the other end pennsylvania avenue yield the floor and suggest the absence quorum
madam president ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call rescinded
president appreciate the opportunity sharing some thoughts this afternoon are going moving forward presumably even this week with the second tranche that the second portion billion the wall street bailout the tarp money and will have that coming and there will attempt move that through have believed from the beginning that was unwise for this congress allow one individual the secretary treasury disburse billion the way this set and even with the way the votes might occur congress very troubling the whole billion will spent the two secretaries treasury without any real accountability without any real responsibility think congress beginning see the lack wisdom that displayed the lack fidelity the responsibilities the senate when passed that bill with little control not even know where the money going and whether secretary paulson who wall street guru moving money around among friends for friendship reasons meritorious reasons even can tell this rushrush effort put out money who deserving and who not deserving not being done open and transparent way indication and further proof that the senate and the congress were not rigorous enough when passed would add one more thing about that something ought not forget hoped not bring but secretary paulson announced that was going buy toxic mortgages bad mortgages from banks order get those off their books said that most them would good and eventually they could sold for profit and the taxpayers would not lose any money and that would the way would this well within weekand was specifically asked one hearing thought should buy stock private banks and said within week had already changed his mind that instead buying toxic mortgages was now going buy stock private american companies and fact has now spent over billion one company aig the insurance company aig competing with other american companies how should they feel ask you that the government now providing billionplus their competitors what about the banks who did things right and were cautious and managed their money well how should they feel about the government injecting capital into their competitors buying stock and what about those who are not the socialist bend what should think about the idea the government buying stock multitude banks tens billions dollars and now buying and investing automobile companies someone said the newspapers are next well guess they are trouble they are not doing well financially they can write lot editorials mean maybe ought make them happy and give them money what saying where does end out that background want have little discussion the possibility stimulus bill that would add some billion the current level deficit spending already have billion there doubt that our economy not performing well know that economies historically are cyclical they through good times and bad times they normally respond are clearly going through very difficult recessionary period the unemployment rate increasing and businesses are struggling had hearing before the budget committee last thursday the director the congressional budget office testified and predicted that this would year recession someone later asked him well did that include the stimulus package and said well would the stimulus package help spending another billion would that help said well might that little less than ringing endorsement did not say that did not pass this bill the economy would never recover and would continue downward spiral forever would say that but think the government can play positive role helping shorten the length the recession that are there are some things prepared discuss and see can agree know presidentelect obama feels very strongly about this has been out campaigning and made promises all could recover this economy intends something and promised something going something now president bush has already done some things that also did not approve doing something can good but doing something may not good you the wrong things aware that the new administration wants our country prosper and there are reasonable commonsense steps can take that say let without delay but want share some thoughts with you about the fundamental truths that think all this country know and especially the area where come from one them that there free lunch nobody can get lunch and say someone did not have work put the table there nothing free when something given somebody pays for there another thing that truism one way the other debts have repaid you say well you know sometimes people bankrupt you not get paid back but the whole system damaged when debts are not paid back the next guy may have pay higher interest rates because his neighbor did not pay his debts and the bank lost money and the bank has got charge higher interest rates account for that higher risk there are costs out there and nothing free this country wish focus this question first what the best thing can for america the long run what should the responsible senate where were supposed the saucer that cools what should and how should approach this issue lets frank the stimulus bill the recovery bill some are calling now may well provide some stimulus the country not sure but would say this its face spending bill spends money order create projects that might create jobs and this the theory behind the effort stimulate the economy spend the money try create jobs relies the theory that ramping government spending will flood the country with money billion worth acting like booster shot for sick economy this not new theory has been tried before all over the world many economists say this type spendingstimulus simply does not work they have cited examples throughout history president bush tried february last year less than year ago when began the process send out check think there general consensus now that the plan that was sold congress stimulus for the economy did not have the desired effect wish were not wish had would point out that did not think the time that would work did not vote for there were not many who did not vote for but was one the few but did not work opinion cost billion every penny that billion since were deficit and was new spending top what planned spend and knew were there deficit added the deficit result basically one piece legislation doubled the annual deficit last year then had some more spending that went later the year will show this chart minute that sort dramatizes where are would say both parties have some fingerprints some policies that have not been very helpful did not ask enough tough questions when president bush proposed his agenda and also did not ask enough questions when they passed the billion bailout october opinion hope not make the mistake again rushing approve the second phase that along with this billion stimulus package need ask the right questions should not intimidated should not panicked the bill does not have passed day else the country going permanently damaged need try improve the economy without wasting money creating longterm problems for the nation there this effort continue what secretary paulson promoted rhetoric that says have got something and have got hurry have got now are still hearing that well think dont need afraid say lets slow this down little bit when something such historic proportions the table bill this magnitude the senate has responsibility carefully scrutinize and insist accountability and responsibility every single dime that why exist that why taxpayers send here someone has ask the tough questions not want dampen anybodys spirits have wonderful new president has positive attitude proposing lot things and nobody wants ask lot grim questions going ask few though because duty first how big this plan how much will cost have heard some general numbers has been stated although still havent seen any details that might between billion and trillion which one thousand three hundred billion dollars that lot money would the single largest government expenditure all time consider the enormity trillion dollars the equivalent paying for the korean vietnam and persian gulf wars once then next question where will the billion trillion come from where will get indicated are deficit now are talking about spending another plus billion where does come from will have borrow every single penny from whomever will lend the money private investors foreign countries have been depending frankly too much foreign countries didnt budget for this billion dont have any money the bank that can get and pay for dont have any savings can draw all trillion will have borrowed since loans have repaid and you have pay people borrow their moneythat what borrowing money you borrow from somebody some country and they are not going give the money for nothingyou have pay them interest every bit will have paid back every american over the years for generations come will have sacrifice pay off the debt incur today the united states indeed deeply debt already about trillion generation probably will not the one pay most that back nor will even our children will probably our grandchildren who will begin feel the heavy burden this debt should consider that then will ask this question what impact will the obama plan have the federal deficit and the national debt this spending program virtually all will increase the deficit which the difference between the money the government takes each year and what spend spend more than take have deficit right now fund that deficit borrow money each year have been running deficit and each year the deficit gets added the total national debt one might ask how these deficits and debts affect well when politicians are responsible and deficits are kept small percentage the gross domestic product probably dont notice the impact interest rates remain low and debt payments are easier make but when have sustained and systemic habit growing deficits the united states becomes riskier investment for people who might like loan money interest rates will and more debt higher interest rates means the taxpayers have pay larger percentage gdp towards interest the debt the most likely way those high payments would met tax hike not sure that the most likely but one way those higher interest payments and higher debt payments will have paid back might tax hike president bush was criticized because under his tenure after after the economic slowdown had big stimulus package and led deficit billion was savaged for billion deficit thought did deserve criticism for that although not well known most americans some work was done the next years bring that deficit down was down billion lot better than billion that amounted percent the gross domestic product this chart reflects that had billion deficit this was the largest deficit since world war president bush was roundly criticized for lot people felt strongly about the next year the deficit dropped billion the next year was the year before last dropped billion were heading the right direction then had the economic slowdown those things have number different ramifications one which when the economy slows down people dont make much money they dont pay much taxes lost about billion expect lose about billion revenue this year according the cbo result the slowdown but last year including the billion stimulus package sending out checks the deficit jumped billion the highest have had since world war percentage the gross domestic product that huge number had hearing last thursday with the congressional budget office acting director longtime professional budgeteer the name sunshine did fabulous job but his remarks werent bright and encouraging the congressional budget office projects that even without any stimulus package under current law the deficit this fiscal year the one are already inwe passed the first quarter and ends september this yearwill trillion remember last year was billion the highest ever this year are looking trillion senator conrad chairman the budget committee and democratic leader the senate good american called that number jaw dropping what else can one say that does not even include the stimulus package add the numbers proposed the stimulus package according sunshine that will reach almost trillion are talking about deficit more than three times the largest amount ever may sound fine businessman heard today very prominent american businessman joe scarboroughs show they asked him about spending and the deficit said well have they asked isnt this going create financial problems the future and the only answer could give was well will worry about that later think little late worry about spending extra billion little late worry about later need worry about when the entity responsible for appropriating money are deciding how much appropriate and for what purpose ought thinking about now before vote this includes some the expenditures for the tarp that they project that the billion bailout and some other things some which are onetime expenditures they project next year the deficit will billion might look like made progress but billion twice what this number almost the next year will billion those numbers still are not the full number because they not include for example about billion year for the alternative minimum tax fix and several other things these are numbers based existing law and each year have not allowed the alternative minimum tax there are other things extend each year does not include extensions the current bush tax cuts which would expire not projecting they will extended but some them sure will those numbers are correct technically but reality they are going larger all probability this deficit almost trillion amounts percent the entire value the american economy the gross domestic product that would the highest real dollar numbers maybe ever percentage the economy the highest since were lifeanddeath struggle world war with millions soldiers deployed all over the world putting their lives the line for this country were building airplanes and ships and tanks with all the capacity this nation had today sunshine told the debt payment are paying each year out tax receipts billion just pay the interest the money already owe let say little bit about that interest rates are oddly very low rate today inevitable though that people will stop loaning money anybody the government anybody else for percent they are going demand higher interest rates that what going happen the cbo predicts that interest rate amount will balloon few years billion year annually the congressional budget office says result our profligate spending and huge deficits now are heading few years point where will spending billion year only interest ask how big billion will give couple examples provide perspectives that are fair consider the years the iraq war cost billion are creating permanent interest rate payment every year that will have paid our children our constituents our constituents today will paying billion every year just interest because had spend much today and last year for responses crises not sure justified this kind spending certainly think many our programs deserve reformed eliminated increased efficiency and lot savings could occur have not been doing that all have been doing spending more and more adding our debt madam president billion the equivalent said the iraq war about onethird the discretionary spending for our country every year recollection that our general fund discretionary spending including the department defense about trillion think that includes the billion for interest now that number goes billion would about third that amount spend more social security and medicare and entitlement programs that separate accountability factor but just the defense department homeland security our salaries highways everything spend money onour interest the debt would that high not little bitty matter big deal the congressional budget office predicts that the share federal expenditures allocated debt payments will increase from percent percent the entire economy that does not include the stimulus plan the president will sending the next question trillion dollars staggering sum money borrow and pay back with interest how know will spent the most efficient way jumpstart our economy and get the most productivity for the taxpayers well the truth not know this proposal will have two components the socalled tax credits and direct spending now have tell you good bit this tax cut temporary and good bit sales job tax cuts tax credit what does that mean well some say percent that will people who not pay taxes how you get tax cut you not pay taxes the government sends you check from the treasury just they did last spring they got you get check from uncle sam that supposed stimulate things and somehow help the economy the congressional budget office really under the supervision the congressand the congress under the control our democratic colleagues they have the majority nowthe cbo rightfully scores these provisions not tax cut but direct spending what else can direct spending taxpayers money send individuals check make them happier for the short term what kind longterm impact will there them their children and the economy the years come what will this unwise prospect create the wall street journal has pointed out many these ideas are temporary and that temporary tax cuts not result positive economic behavior but more permanent change when people know permanent does have more impact helping our economy permanent tax relief includingi have say please not think this way pander big business but the corporate tax rate america one the highest the world percent ireland think percent most european nationsonly one two nations have high tax rate the corporate community which gets passed cost doing business and makes those corporations less competitive the world marketplace would lot better shape could reduce that more permanent way then those companies could see well saving corporate tax rate will not have lay off many people can keep this company going maybe can invest and more competitive when export because not have much burden and would help this economy want say many economists truly believe the corporate tax not that reduced would actually encourage economic growth and create more jobs know that just rapid expenditures huge amounts money have never been very effective way grow the economy are these spending programsthis billion plusis that going end cold turkey years have doubts about want tell you have doubts about the wisdom our idea that can jumpstart the economy pumping billion into they are talking aboutyou have heard these numberswell are going spend good bit money the infrastructure everybody likes highways everybody knows they are there for generations come highways and bridges have good things that can said about them and can make our lives better there always line formed whenever there highway money with people wanting build more highways and more bridges currently the federal government which spends lot money highways spends according sunshine around billion year highways states match percent basis percent federal states percent some areas percent federal percent state use this matching mechanism fund highway construction this country and amounts billion year are talking about billion years you take the billion and cut two that billion each year now from billion year for highways billion well lets say you only spend billion with billion that billion more per year for highways times what are currently spending would suggest those kinds figures are unrealistic when the chips are down doubt are going see anything like that much money being allocated highways because cannot spent there are not enough asphalt mixers there are not enough concrete mixers there are not enough dump trucks actually spend that much money that fact you cannot triple the amount work and you the bid per mile and the cost per mile going way there going shortage dealing with everything construction simply cannot throw money road construction and infrastructure has understood that since some this dropping off result economic slowdowns can put that back and maybe little top and keep this thing going more healthy rate that may possible and willing discuss that but ought not sell the stimulus package that being discussed that somehow the biggest chunk going get spent highways right billion maybe billion year extra billion out billion where the rest going spent stimulate the economy ask shovel ready they say not know what that means but know you could not start off the next few months and triple the number highways built america there are not enough engineers there not enough heavy equipment there not enough material that you were even try would drive the cost and would spend lot money lot more would make much more expensive per mile build highways america have careful about that well they also talk about how there going more money this bill for the automobile companies and maybe bailout for state governments they need more money too dont they why doesnt the federal government which sort prints moneywhy dont bail out our good friends the state level unemployment insurance going need expanded and some are talking about expanding broadband and course hiring additional government employees that part what being discussed here the washington post said course many these items were featured presidentelect barack obamas campaign pledges there was fine column dionne who openly good liberal columnist and has been proobama writer throughout dionne said has been rather fortunate for the obama campaign that can utilizeand paraphrasing now but think this close the heart what saidit very fortunate for presidentelect obama that all the spending promised can now justified and they can call bailout stimulus package and not just big spending program think have ask questions about that can justify this fundamentally every dollar spend part regular government spending programs this stimulus program should result effective return the taxpayers have money waste are time unprecedented incredible deficits ought not waste single dollar cannot all agree that finally question would how will americans pay the trillion dollars back there are three ways cutting spending the future not hear anybody saying need cutting spending not the majority side here talk about education health care highways expanding the number military personnel all these things cost money not see any realistic prospect will see any huge reduction spending have tell you you could raise taxes but not like raising taxes have tried oppose that throughout career presidentelect obama says wants give everybody tax break who going raise taxes any significant way you can tax the rich and get little out them when the economy doing pretty good when the economy goes down and the rich income drops dramatically the countrys tax revenue also drops dramatically not think are going get lot money from that one way for happen and would result more pernicious than many have thought about would where would basically debase the currency would weaken the value the dollar you borrow billion from somebody and you pay them back billion but you printed lot more dollars the dollars they get paid back are less valuable than the ones they gave you when you borrowed that pretty slick deal isnt that what you call inflation there are huge ramifications from that kind policy that are very damaging the longterm health america not need debase our currency that why the price gold jumped people get scared the dollar not going worth anything think the debate are about begin really about individual responsibility and governmental responsibility need resist the cries many who have selfinterests this stimulus package heard one prominent businessman make speech recently said are going after this money well put out there every business going after and happy get have responsible need scrutinize need act the longterm interests america believe congress far has not done well responding the economic crisis are going through think everybody pretty well universally has agreed that the billion sendoutthechecks program did not benefit the economy heard group wellknown economists recently agree that the first billionremember the entire iraq war has cost billionthat billion the first tranche money that has gone out has not helped the economy think have careful hope congress will not fail our constituents again making sure that the fiscal illness are living with now does not damage our children know people are hurting know people are worried that their job might not exist the months come you are working the clothing store not sure some these jobs are going that helpful you but any rate that the kind thing are dealing with people are worried are going through serious downturn the cbo expert told are going come out this years his opinionand was firm about whether did anything not said stimulus package might help another member the panel said well should help but neither one said was critical coming out the recession whatever whatever monies spendand not against every idea for stimulating the economylets just sure productive approving trillion deficit spending could more harm than good dont right time that nation stop living beyond our means need get our house order need know there free lunch that debts will have repaid one way the otherraising taxes cutting spending the future debasing the currency that basically the way can reduce the debt and those are the only ways can are putting burden the future know some money invested now might make positive difference lets talk about that and lets see what can but the numbers being floated out and the rapidity with which the program being proposed creates mind great danger that much the money will not stimulative has failed the past and that much will not produce the kind tangible benefit which the taxpayers are entitled madam president thank the chair and yield the floor

president wish take few minutes this evening respond some the comments that have been hearing from colleagues the other side the aisle expressing great concern about the spending recovery package for america are talking about today find quite extraordinary when hear colleagues talking about objecting spending federal dollars right nowfederal dollars that would add the deficitgiven where have come from the last years find quite extraordinary remember back when was the house representatives serving with the distinguished presiding officer when took some very tough votes and did lot hard work under president clinton actually balanced the budget for the first time years that put course eliminate the deficit strengthen the country create the right kinds priorities for the american people result that action when came into the senate new member the budget committee were debating what with the biggest surplus american history trillion how should address the largest surplus had seen the federal budget the time the democrats the committee proposed that divide that surplus into three parts one for tax cuts geared the middle class two for investments create jobs invest education and future opportunities and three help strengthen social security that was rejected instead all know now very large supplyside tax cut trickledown economics was passed constituents january are still waiting for trickle down their pockets but that was put place which began process that has now led the highest deficits the history the country just years that was coupled with war that was not paid for over billion month and certainly the most important thing has been the loss life then saw just the end the year effort provide billion what has been dubbed the bailout wall streetto date suggest not very effective and times outrageous terms what has happened with that money not that the federal government has spend money not that colleagues the other side the aisle have not supported spending they supported spending for years the question what are going spend and for whom many americans have seen their standard living down their jobs away their houses away their opportunities away while some have done very well under particular kind spending over the last years what suggest this not about whether spend invest use federal dollars about our values and priorities whom are going invest where are going spend the dollars have had many people michigan say with all the debates going where bailout sure you heard that president where bailout small business owners where bailout individuals suggest what are debating the american people bailout the investment america the people this country have resoundingly rejected the policies the last years that have gotten where are today that what elections are about people have said very loudly dont want the same policies dont want the same people espousing the same policies going forward have seen the last years where have those policies over the last years gotten over the last years have not seen commitment manufacturing this country some people say that only narrow special interest for certain number states the country suggest foundation the middle class this country the fact that have lost million manufacturing jobs due the policies the last years those jobs just last yearthat totally relates where are terms jobs this country what happening this country and what happening middleclass people the economic activity the manufacturing sector has fallen its lowest level years that absolutely equates the challenges are currently having this economy million jobs just general were lost the worst year since years policies put forward the current administration and supported many people who have been the floor since came back into session arguing should not something different should not try different kind investment policy should not focus jobs america the middle class and should keep doing the way have been doing that basically what are hearing the floor the same kinds things that have gotten these numbersi million jobs lost last month last month million americans december million people were unemployed and wonder why they cannot pay their mortgages and their homes are going into foreclosure the jobless rate the highest years and know not going get better quickly know least the first half this yearpossibly the entire yearis going very tough know that but common sense would say that not embrace the same policies that have gotten this point want get out the hole exciting that next week are going swear wonderful new president who has policies working with working with all together that will stop digging the hole and begin bring out the hole even though know deep hole and has certainly stressed that wisely with the american people are going begin come out this hole over and over again the last week have been hearing colleagues objecting change economic policy and proposing the same old thing the same old thing has put situation where the median home price fell percent the last year which the fastest pace since the that what the kinds policies are hearing the other side the aisle have achieved president foreclosures happen every day today have been session families have seen their homes foreclosed upon tomorrow there will another families the next day families that what the policiesaction and inactionof the last years have done one ten homeowners with mortgage either foreclosure delinquent payments pension plans you are fortunate enough have had job worked hard all your life and put money into pensionmaybe you did not take pay raise order make sure you had that pensionhave suffered their steepest year drop years the average pension fund now holding assets that would cover only about percent what had been promised workers could and with the numbers and you know them well the good news the american people have looked around what has happened the trickledown economic policies the last yearsthe idea that cant afford invest education for the future health care focus jobs for the futurethey have looked those policies and said more more have had enough that brings this point and will have the opportunity the next few weeks bring forward economic recovery plan that focuses very different way are going tax cuts want tax cuts for middleclass families and those working hard get into the middle class benefit from those and that the policy will see coming forward are going see policies that will create jobs rebuilding america have heard colleagues the other side the aisle saying gosh they want not only talk about roads and bridges and water and sewer systems but they want talk about broadbandthe idea connecting rural communities and small businesses the internet they can sell around the world just like big business does goodness you mean they want everybody have access the internet not just some people yes that true believe the new highway the information highway that power needs available every child every small business every farmer the end the road just built the electricity systems the telephone systems the past need make sure are building for the future america everyone has access these new technologies have opportunity for jobs and income and education also very involved making sure can computerize our health care system can cut costs from unnecessary paperwork that can also provide the very best quality health care every hospital large and small whether you live small rural area urban hospital where you would suburban hospital need focus jobs rebuilding america and reinvesting not only the upfront construction jobs but what that will mean the assets that will there afterwards which very much part this recovery plan know want see

that part our vision for recovery package for the future because have been working closely with advanced manufacturing the auto industry know interesting statistic that everyone had electric car todayand would certainly like that happen from environmental standpointwe would blow the electrical grid this country poof would deep trouble part what need have happen upgrade have better electric system able handle those new vehicles need create new kind infrastructure that when you pull your vehicle which would get miles perwhat shall say not miles per gallon because not gallon miles the road charge wouldnt great able pull and charge parking lot parking meter you went into the store there are many ways need build and rebuild america for this new technological world are this new green

serious issue global warming but can create jobs america goodpaying jobs america that what this recovery plan does and very excited work with the incoming administration and see their vision and their commitment working with there are many pieces this that will addressed will mention one other and that when talked earlier about the numbers regarding unemployment and housing and pensions and what happening people have seen now close decade yearsof neglect not paying attention those who have been hurt the policies that have been place very important that fact recognize that have more people out work than there are currently available jobspeople who have worked all their lives people who want work who recognize the dignity work but the short run need some help part this package needs address this well whether unemployment insurance whether food assistance whether help with health care during transition whether addressing those who have lost their jobs because trade those priorities represent the best america and who are our real values and priorities americans understanding that are global economy and that transition best even everything was going well even every policy was going well has created pain and suffering for those caught the middle unfortunately because series policies whether not enforcing our trade laws fairly whether not addressing health care seeing the cutbacks education and too many people have been hurt and need some help too many people have been hurt the last years very important part this recovery plan well make sure those families know see them hear them that americans care about them and want make sure they have the temporary assistance they need while are creating these jobs the new economy there lot work all know and would conclude

remains major force conspiring raise oil prices the detriment american consumers the recent actions the opec cartel demonstrate the dangers presents opec doing everything can raise oil prices october opec agreed cut production million barrels day don december opec agreed further million barrels day production cut the opec cartel makes secret its motivation for these production cuts opec president chaib khelil put very simply interview published december without these cuts dont think wed seeing per barrel today wed have seen the opefully the third quarter will see prices rising another interview december khelil was quoted saying the stronger the decision cut production the faster prices will pick and the price crude oil begins rise again result these actions opec there doubt that millions american consumers will feel the pinch every time they visit the gas pump the federal trade commission has estimated that percent the variability the cost gasoline the result changes the cost crude oil such blatantly anticompetitive conduct the oil cartel violates the most basic principles fair competition and free markets and should not tolerated private companies engaged such

entirely the justice department and ultimately the president they can use this tool they see fitto file legal action jawbone opec diplomatic discussions defer from any action should they judge foreign policy other considerations warrant nopec will also make plain that the nations opec cannot hide behind the doctrines sovereign immunity act state escape the reach american justice doing our amendment will overrule one year old lower court decision which incorrectly failed recognize that the actions opec member nations was commercial activity exempt from the protections sovereign immunity the most

president wish speak briefly about the contest minnesota involving the senate seat currently held senator norm coleman obviously the other new members the senate were sworn last week but this seat remains empty winner yet undeclared clear under minnesota law that the way has right now because there election contest that hasbeen filed the courts and under minnesota law therefore neither the secretary state nor the governor can declare the seat filled senator coleman had been declared the winner election night and through the ensuing administrative canvassing process but throughout the following state canvassing board stage the proceedings there were numerous inconsistencies and problems uncovered and the boardcertified totals were different they are obviously issue and they are preliminary the minnesota state canvassing board totals for example include more votes than voters significant number the minnesota precincts clearly there something wrong and has resolved the court the coleman campaign has followed minnesota election law filing election contest and that comes before threejudge panel minnesota before the end this month the contest based significant errors wish mention four these categories folks will understand what issue first newly discovered ballots which appeared for the first time during the recount and are included the state canvassing board totals second missing ballots supposedly tallied election night but which could not found during the recount process obviously problem third doublecounting duplicate and original ballots the same voter during the recount process fourth wrongly rejected absentee ballots and inconsistent standards regarding what constitutes wrongly rejected absentee ballot applied different locations throughout the state let discuss each these briefly turn the newly discovered ballots there are such ballots that appeared without explanation several days after the election ramsey county precinct maplewood election officials were unable reconcile the number votes cast with the number voters signed but the board nevertheless included the additional votes franken favor its totals furthermore the board directed that this issue should properly dealt with during the contest phase and that course now occurring the missing ballots there were ballots hennepin county that could not found during the recount and were declared missing despite the fact that there are any number possible reasons for the change including the possibility that the ballots never existed the first place but instead following consistent standard and including the new recount total the board reverted election night totals again resulting more votes for franken the doublecounting least precincts minnesota there are more votes than voters the canvassing boards totals and there are separate incident logs prepared local recount officials describing issues involving duplicate and original ballot counting this due the counting both the voters original ballot and duplicate ballot which was created take the place the original ballot resulting doublecounting some votes when both those ballots are included the total that obviously blatant error and one that threatens the sanctity one person one vote obviously most people get one vote those who got more than one vote have advantage for whom they cast their ballot both the canvassing board and the minnesota supreme court directed the issue dealt with during the election contest that issue now being dealt with finally the category wrongly rejected absentee ballots during the recount process fifth pile was created for absentee ballots that were rejected but not because one the four reasons stipulated minnesota election law this fifth pile was requested the franken campaign the time they were trailing the count and the canvassing board granted the request without issuing any direction ensure consistency among the counties their review vast number these ballots which happened generate more votes for franken were included the canvassing board total however the board also refused review over ballots requested the coleman campaign can see there are obviously some issues resolved the threejudge panel will appointed the campaigns will convene with the panel set forth the ground rules for the election contest trial and then that will occur there are stipulations for when the proceedings must completed and estimations are least from folks minnesota hat could take month not more part that context the coleman campaign has requested the review hundreds more ballots that may have been wrongly rejected because the size the pool ballots reviewed and the erroneous recount totals including questionable votes for franken senator coleman has expressed confidence that the numbers will revert back where they were election night and his lead will restored and then would declared the winner obviously this for the canvassing board and the court minnesota resolve not for prejudge the result this time unfortunately the majority leader and his staff have publicly stated they would try seat franken while the contest still proceeding despite the fact there not signed certificate which required every senator this dates back this action course was blocked and presume the process will continue regular order await the result the proceedings true franken attempted declare himself the winner yesterday the campaign requested the governor and secretary state send him certificate could seated but was course not granted because both officials indicated correctly that would directly violate state law are left with the matter vacancy minnesota with the issue resolved the people minnesota properly under their law the canvassing board and the threejudge court for part certainly hope this phase will not fall prey inconsistencies and problems that have led some experts and newspaper editorials claim the election process needs fundamentally reformed done the proper way and due care for the evidence that presented then hopefully everyone will satisfied with the result and willing abide that result will then come the senate and will seat the appropriate candidate the republicans ask for nothing more are certainly hopeful our former colleague and soontobe current colleague senator coleman will resume his seat but that for the process minnesota determine not for that determined some arbitrary way the senate
president how much time reserved for this side the aisle
thank the distinguished presiding officer good friend from montana
president today received report from the department justices office the inspector general and office professional responsibility about their investigation allegations politicized hiring and other improper personnel actions the civil rights division held hearings this situation the time there was bradley schlozman who testified stated the time that did not find his testimony credible todays report confirms some our worst fears about the bush administrations political corruption the justice department not only did senior republican appointees violate federal law hiring based politics the civil rights division they also lied about indeed they lied about under oath when they were called explain themselves congress particularly disturbed about the findings that senior justice department appointee very senior justice department appointee bradley schlozman made false statements under oath when appearing before the senate judiciary committee lying congress undermines the very core our constitutional principles and blunts the american peoples right open and transparent government one thing have witness come and say they disagree with the members congress that fine everybody has constitutional right that nobody has right lie under oath nobody has the right break the law and certainly senior member the justice department should not able consider himself above the law not only did schlozman lie and the committee but then refused cooperate with the justice depart ments own internal oversight offices investigation into illegal hiring practices the departments civil rights division the clear determination that broke the law corrodes our trust our system justice and the nations top law enforcement agency somebody can break the law our nations top law enforcement agency the department justice what does that say the rest americans his actions fact undermine the very mission the departments civil rights division which charged with enforcing federal law and prohibiting discrimination strong and independent civil rights division has long been crucial the enforcement our precious civil rights laws and experienced and committed career attorneys have always been the heart and soul that division the past the people who worked there matter how much time you spent with them you wouldnt know they were republicans democrats all you would know that these folks who are among the brightest and best lawyers the country are dedicated serving the united states america and upholding our laws contrary those traditions however which have had both republican and democratic administrations this report details troubling revelations political appointees who marginalize and force out career lawyers because ideology and corrupt the hiring process for career positions should come surprise that the result and course the intent this political makeover the civil rights division has been dismala dismalcivil rights enforcement record this report just one the final chapters the regrettable legacy the bush administration main justice and reinforces the need for new leadership now more than ever necessary confirm new leadership the justice department starting with attorney generaldesignee eric holder compliment the departments office inspector general they did not allow politics stand their way they went and investigated this situation wish the current attorneys office appointed this administration had decided prosecute someone for these deplorable acts think the only way you stop such blatant criminal violations especially people who know better people who are sworn uphold the law that they know they will jail for breaking the law that what should have been done they broke the law the bush administration and the bush administration decide not prosecute and think that raises real questions prosecution should done matter who breaks the law recall one the people who testified that same investigation who said swear oath president george bush said you swear oath uphold the constitution president that constitution the constitution you are sworn uphold and sworn uphold constitution that reflects all americans the government not person indeed whether you support individual not the government for all americans the constitution for all americans when somebody deliberately purposely sets out subvert the constitution the united states and then lies about itlies about presidenti find that heinous crime when see some child who steals car they will prosecuted probably they should but when yov have key member the department justice who lies under oath who subverts the constitution the united states that all the more reason prosecute that person what schlozman did was reprehensible was disgusting and was wrong but also contradicts the very core americas principles the distinguished presiding officer like had the great opportunity serve prosecutor and have every reason believe did not show fear favor when brought prosecution did not did not show fear favor most prosecutors not yet here have somebody who part the justice department lie under oath and way cover and subvert the very laws that protect all our civil rights laws are the books protect all protects all uswhite black brownno matter what our race our creed protects all what has marked this country since the time was young lawyer the has been our adherence those civil rights laws cant goback time where they are enforced for some and not for others president hope people readi will not put the record because availablethis investigation allegations politicized hirings and other improper political actions the civil rights division the department justice chilling going suggest that every new person coming into the department justice read this investigation handbooknot what dobut handbook what not president yield the floor and suggest the absence quorum

president yesterday president bush announced that was sending congress formal notice regarding use the second half tarp the troubled asset relief program you know under that legislation which congress passed over objection last year once billion the fundhalf the fundis spent and the administration wants begin spending the second half the fundthe second billionthe president has formally notify congress under the program congress has the opportunity basically veto moving forward affirmatively having pass resolution disapproval again president bush took that first step formally notifying congress yesterday and today come the senate floor announce that introducing motion disapproval and encourage colleagues democrats and republicans think very seriously about this matter and join this motion disapproval doing immediately joined several colleagues and want thank senators bunning sessions demint barrasso and inhofe for being original cosponsors with the resolution disapproval when debated this very important matter this floor several months ago expressed serious concerns will not through comments then concerns but unfortunately sadly many themvirtually allhave been proven true the history this programthe troubled asset relief programhas indeed been very troubled very concerning and raises far more questions and hesitations than provides answers for our ailing economy revisit this issue cannot support moving forward with this very troubled program primarily for five reasons first among those reasons the most fundamental test should bring the matter has the program worked think very clear has not worked the purpose the program was ease the credit crisis the entire focus the program was get credit the streets the american economy provide reasonable credit consumers and businesses yet our economy still gripped real credit crunch that fundamental purpose the program that fundamental test the program has simply not been met now president this new year and under the new administration are going debate and act other measures particularly the stimulus plan stimulus plan which will spend upwards trillion that presidentelect obama has talked about and begun outline certainly must act the economy certainly are very serious recession almost certainly the most serious the worst since world war and certainly the federal government needs help lead the way big part the solution get out this deep financial recession but move trillion stimulus program why are going simply continue with program that hasnt worked spending another billion again mount trillions dollars new deficit spending deficits upon deficits debt upon debt surely should think long and hard about continuing another billion spending very troubled program which has not begun meet its fundamental goal the second reason would suggest should not continue down this path that the entire program was outlined congress was explained the treasury secretary and others has never been implemented was thrown out the window even before could begin implemented all remember just few months ago when the treasury secretary proposed this idea before congress was indeed supposed the troubled asset relief program under which the government would buy troubled assets from spectrum financial institutions get those assets off the books the financial institutions and make those institutions far healthier and far more able extend credit individuals and businesses across america that was the beginning that was the middle and that was the end the program that was what every explanation every presentation was about the treasury secretary the chairman the federal reserve and others came capitol hill explain this program over severalweeks wasnt part the program was the entire program yet within couple weeks congress passing the troubled asset relief programagain over objectionthat plan was completely thrown out the window congress acts pass billion spending program forging completely new ground terms economic policy and the governments intervention the market and within few weeks that action plan completely out the window and the treasury secretary sets about forming plan and doing something fundamentally different than was presented congress have suggested over the last several weeks along with colleagues that alone should make the administration come back congress and get reauthorization for what completely new program that again second reason should not continue the tarp and continue going down this path and spending the second billion this program the third reason would offer closely related the second said within weeks congress passing this legislation the whole program changed the entire concept buying troubled assets was out the window and treasury had brandnew plan which was never presented congress and never discussed any level detail what has happened the tarp has become veritable slush fund for the administration whatever

president here today speak about the growing violence gaza support the united nations security council resolution calling for immediate and durable ceasefire view both the israeli airstrikes and the palestinian rocket attacks must stop immediately and israeli ground forces should withdraw from gaza regret that president bush chose have the united states the only security council member not support this resolution ask unanimous consent that the full text the resolution printed the record
last week the senate responded the hostilities passing res resolution that not support while agree with some parts the resolution believe left out important provisions the resolution called for hamas end the rocket and mortar attacks but did not call israel stop its airstrikes and ground assault nor did the resolution call israel withdraw from gaza moreover believe the resolution downplayed the humanitarian situation gaza thousands people gaza not have access food clean water medical care the foreign minister david miliband speaking about humanitarian conditions gaza said the word crisis which sometimes overused wholly appropriate describe how bad things are made that statement describe how bad saw that things are this time support israels right defend itself israel has stronger ally than the united states and have better friend the region than israel but friends can make mistakes the rocket attacks that israel has suffered are unacceptable but believe israels use force has been excessive and not believe will help israel achieve its longterm goals instead weakening hamas the incursion boosting support for hamas both among palestinians and the arabic world and undermining support for moderates the region instead making israels enemies fear its military power believe this conflict shows its enemies that they can taunt israel into reacting strongly that undermines its international support instead rebutting the accusations that israel has ignored the longdeepening humanitarian crisis gaza the growing death toll and worsening living conditions will fuel similar accusations long into the future this violence but another chapter violence the long history the middle east what needed international effort broker immediate truce and build that into lasting peace lasting peace requires twostate solution hard see how such agreement can achieved without the deep involvement and leadership the united states have been disappointed that the bush administration has failed lead the peace process for the past years president obama should not repeat that mistake after takes office next week should appoint special envoy the region soon after his secretary state confirmed the senate president obama should commit his administration steady and persistent effort engage both israelis and palestinians finding political solution the conflict that has long plagued this region exirr

madam president rise speak today about topic that the news important and has with area leavenworth very near the presiding officers state and home state about the issue the guantanamo bay detainees simple point this issue there very strong pushand understand that push and one that has been going for some period timeto close guantanamo bay would simply make the point should not attempt forcefit detainees where they not belong and where does not fit not believe the new administration can look constituents the eye and say them they are going safe with detainees fort leavenworth they are with military prisoners fort leavenworth and particularly not with what are talking about from guantanamo bay have invited presidentelect obama and his teath come leavenworth look this facility see this something that could fit and work not believe does all but have invited them there come and look and make their own assessment further call the incoming administration conduct thorough studya thorough studyof all possible locations where detainees could transferred the study must seriously assess the legal and security requirements for detainees well the impact the areas surrounding proposed detainee location the end believe the detainees will probably need one three types places overseas either the custody foreign nations military facilities abroad set for these types detainees have guantanamo bay military land facilities previously closed scheduled closed under the brac process the base realignment and closure commission into new facility specifically designed for these detainees the administration projecting they are going sign order right off when coming into office that going close guantanamo bay asking them looking state looking the disciplindry barracks leavenworth that they consider the nature the facility the nature the detainee and make careful assessment whether this fits this situation let describe for you little bit the situation the disciplinary barracks fort leavenworth fort leavenworth small facility roughly miles miles primary mission facility for education the military the command and general staff college for the military for the army they outstanding job that they outstanding job not only for the militaryparticularly for the armythey have all branches the services that come there trained but they also have any one time students from different countries this facility recently spoke graduation exercise there with number students who were coming out program and the president uganda was there because his son was graduating from this program one the key problems with relocating the detainees from guantanamo bay fort leavenworth that number islamic countries will not send students now fort leavenworth detainees are being held there who they dont believe should detained the first place then you start break these militarytomilitary ties that have been important for able work concert withplaces such saudi arabia kuwait the good work have been able some cases back and forth pakistan although not nearly enough need lot moreand better but you break that tie where you are training these military officers side side and then building relationships that work back and forth and then you start moving toward well the saudis arent going send anybody the command and general staff college the united states because detainees who they believe their countries shouldnt held are being held the same facility that squaremile facility then the kuwaitis dont and the pakistanis dont and you start breaking these types ties the major purpose fort leavenworth education not discipline then there the problem with the nature the disciplinary barracks itself primarily medium disciplinary facility fort leavenworth not maximum not have the space able contain all the detainees from guantanamo bay dont even have enough space contain what would referred the worst the worst from the guantanamo bay facility the disciplinary barracks fort leavenworth plus against the law mix military population where have had people from the military who have committed crime and they are being held the disciplinary barracksyou cannot mix that population under law with population foreign detainees that against the law against conventions have entered into there that legal hurdle that there well now let further describe the facility has major railroad that runs through has train coming through regular basis times day the security concern that raises moving detainees from guantanamo bayvery high visibilityto the middle the country but place where people could try spring them are they going use the railroad track are they going try bomb put bombs the railroad coming through real problem dont have exterior fence have the missouri river but that fairly navigable able move across for terrorist population somebody who trying get into the perimeter the facility make through are not set that way within major urban area kansas city kansas city straddles both the kansas and the missouri side leavenworth the edge that the northern edge that kansas city complex you are moving the detainees from guantanamo bay confined facility away from major urban areas and right into major urban area the united states that doesnt make much sense going very difficult going impossible and then look constituents the eye and look the constituents the presiding officer the eye and say you are going safe you have military detainees are used handling the prison population leavenworth have multiple set facilities have federal penitentiary have state penitentiary have private penitentiary and have military penitentiary the community very well adapted able handle prison populations does very well but the community does not want this population because they say are not set able handle this population think this community that does not say not back yard because they have been willing take prisoners for some period time they are just saying they are not set for this prison population our back yard cant handle this for all these reasons would urge the administrationthe incoming obama administrationto take very hard serious scholarly view what you can with the guantanamo bay detainees would ask them take very serious look the logistical problems leavenworth know number the people who are involved fort leavenworth are deeply concerned about the fact that they have number schoolchildren who are educated the fort leavenworth military base because the commandand general staff college get people assigned there for year years sometimes longer periods time and families move there have schools operate the military base are deeply concerned about somebody coming wanting make statement and going into one those schools and taking the children hostage have seen situations where number people are put harms way for good reason whatsoever and seeing that this facility not set able this one them have visited with people locally have call scheduled with secretary gates have been putting this forward legislative form prior legislative sessions and will this legislative session well make this point had been easy close guantanamo bay previously certain the current administration would have done difficult task but that doesnt mean that because difficult task then you fast means because difficult task you take your time and you right you are going create lot more coi problems down the road this one where think the loss this situation far greaterfar greaterthan any gain would get closing the guantanamo bay facility particularly our relationship islamic countries would plead with the new administration look this very serious and very clear and very analytical way make wise decision that will stand for the future and not just create huge set problems for the future with that yield the floor and note the absence quorum

bidding such airline does locks future price for fuel bidding these future oil contracts airline fact does use oil taking away the regulation they have removed that ability give another example regulation commodities futures trading commission could say you have put certain amount money down you are going buy future oil contract instead getting with nothing down you have put some skin the game but you completely deregulate what you leave the speculator and bid that price and and now this what have been saying the floor this senate for the last months number ussenator dorgan senator cantwell this senator and several other senatorsbut has been hard get audience that would listen well less respected institution than cbs news minutes last sunday night broke open and put about clearly have ever heard posing this question did speculation fuel oil price swings and what they concluded was that months ago when oil hit its alltime high and gas was around gallon created frenzy that fed into irrational and false claims that the problem was just supply and demand and that the solution was drill for more oil well looks lot different now that frenzy that got mixed presidential politics well with those simplified mantras drill baby drill fueled slick public relations campaign that was funded deeppocket oil companies yet those same oil companies testified the spring that supply and demand were the sole driver oil prices that oil should cost more than barrel had executives two the big major oil companies say the normal laws supply and demand would say that oil ought the range barrel and they testified this senator thinks correctly ask yourself could supply and demand justify the wild swings prices and that one instance where oil jumped day for barrel oil ask yourself could the new oil demands china and india that have needs for new oil products could that have suddenly caused that price jump much single day and the answer clearly was speculation that caused that bubble grow wall street investors shifted billions dollars out the stock market and into the commodities futures market and ultimately into oil and that what was the biggest driver running the price oil and gasoline what even more powerful demonstrating the influence speculators oil prices examining what happened those prices after the senate and down the other end the capitol the house started threatening regulation again well guess what happened the prices went down when wall street experienced financial meltdown with the collapse lehman brothers and the near collapse aig prices fell even more the wall street speculators got out the oil futures markets the tune billion the speculative bubble commodities which was not only energy but agricultural commodities all sudden bubble popped demand for oil the united states down percent but the price oil down percent shouldnt fooled the drop prices some financial analysts fortunately are not fooled the drop prices they are advising investors that low oil prices are temporary phenomenon and that oil prices will average above barrel over the next years well number months ago filed bill stop the trading oil and other energy commodities the unregulated exchanges and what the bill does turns the clock back change law that was pushed the enron corporation known the enron loophole which opened the way for flood speculative money these commodity markets introducing that bill again today and seek our colleagues support must vigilant ensure that wall street investors not take advantage the lax regulation reap profits driving the price oil and making driving lot more expensive for the rest let remember that saw what happened with another form unregulated financial instruments that was those insurance policies that had fancy name called credit default swaps they were unregulated look what happened the collapse aig that had come the tune upward billion rescue from the federal government dont believe simple coincidence that the same legislation that let those credit default swaps escape regulation also allowed energy traders conduct their business the shadows need bring that industry out the darkness and into the full light day president wish quote couple lines from this sundays interview cbs news minutes representative the petroleum marketers association interviewed gilligan and says approximately percent the oil contracts the futures markets are now held speculative entities not the companies that need oil not the airlines not the oil companies but investors that are looking make money from their speculative positions now that representative the oil companies that said that furthermore the investigative reporter steve kroft quotes fellow named michael masters and states fiveyear period masters said the amount money institutional investors hedge funds and the big wall street banks had placed the commodities markets went from billion billion last year barrels crude were being traded every day the new york mercantile exchange for every barrel oil that was actually being consumed the united states that krofts analysis minutes and was referring former wall street trader named michael masters wish end further quoting kroft from minutes recent report out mit analyzing world oil production and consumption also concluded that the basic fundamentals supply and demand could not have been responsible for last years runup oil prices another quote from interviewee from quarter four until the second quarter that month period the energy information administration said that supply went worldwide supply went and worldwide demand went down this was the period the spike oil prices you had the largest price increase history during time when actual demand was going down and actual supply was going during that same period the only thing that makes sense that lifted the price was investor demand other words the speculators making artificial demand think clear that why introducing this legislation look forward with great optimism the passage this kind legislation president ask unanimous consent that the text the bill and minutes transcript printed the record
president over the past few days have introduced series bills that are part initiative dubbed because its focus economy employment education and energy today introducing two bills that are part this effort the community revitalization energy conservation crec act and the energy and technology advancement eta aut the newest among bills the community revitalization energy conservation crec act this bill will increase the amount funding available state and local governments for the rehabilitation and revitalization the fledgling green economy and also expand the types eligible projects cover energy efficiency improvements privately owned buildings while our country facing its greatest economic challenge since the great depression have tremendous opportunity create jobs critical addressing the energy challenges face the crec act amends the recently authorized qualified energy conservation bond qecb program increase funding for important publicprivate partnerships significantly invest energy efficiency and conservation key national priority also offers states and local governments the opportunity create jobs and stimulate their local economies first bill will more than quadruple the amount bonds that can issued under the qualified energy conservation bond programincreasing the program from million billion this will provide the opportunity for private investors partner with state and local governments fund energy investments through state and locally issued tax credit bonds give private investors the opportunity participate the green economy through qualified energy conservation bonds signal the market that the federal government will continue affirm the importance investment energy efficiency and conservation well the development new energy technologies helping these new energy teqhnologies thrive not only promising way develop the next generation energy technology reduce our energy consumption will also help spur job creation state and local governments embark capital improvements increasing the size the program will support funding for eligible projects including energy efficiency improvements publicly owned buildings rural development electricity from renewable sources research facilities grants for renewable technologies such advanced automobile battery technology and nonfossil fuels mass commuting facilities that reduce energy consumption financing qualified energy production projects such wind biomass geothermal landfill gas and solar secondly bill expands the types eligible programs ones that reduce energy consumption privately owned buildings would allow states and local governments help homeowners and businesses make improvements such heatingfuel saving measures electricitysaving measures onsite renewable energy generating devices watersaving measures that reduce the energy use the owner renter watir prnvider gains efficiency savings between percent are easily achievable through improving lighting insulation hvac equipment and controls for these items these measures are often onetime and low maintenance maintenance free once they have been installed terms costs implementing efficiency measures only costs about cents per kwh energy saved while implementing wind and solar projects can cost least two three times more importantly bill will increase the success these energy efficiency and conservation programs ensuring the qualified energy conservation bond program can used promote novel payment structures order reduce the prohibitive upfront costs that homeowners and businesses must pay for energy efficiency and conservation upgrades eliminating expensive upfront costs for homeownersand businesses can eliminate one the main obstacles making significant energy efficiency gains furthermore can virtually eliminate what homeowners and businesses have pay for the efficiency and conservation upgrades not increasing their outofpocket expenses for example states and local governments can work with electric and water utilities bill individuals businesses monthly for the cost the efficiency improvements based the savings they receive the payment for the efficiency improvements each month will more than the monthly energysavings realized the improvements thereby keeping their monthly payments the same before the energy improvements the center wisconsin strategy states that buildings account for percent total energy consumption percent electricity consumption and percent carbon emissions larger share than either transportation industry possible that the could realize more than billion annual savings from improved building efficiency alone however one the challenges associated with implementing building efficiency measures its prohibitive cost unfortunately poor households devote disproportionate share income home energy costs often upwards percent because they have less income and tend live less efficient buildings and use less efficient appliances through building retrofits have the potential generate about person years employment direct installation efficiency measures and another person years the production relevant materials for every million spent retrofits

president rise today with colleague senator akaka introduce legislation today designed make several very important changes current law ensure that citizens receive the medicaid which they are entitled since july most citizens and nationals applying for renewing their medicaid coverage face new federal requirement provide documentation their citizenship status recent reports indicate that tensofthousands citizens and particular children inappropriately are being denied medicaid benefits simply because they dont have access newly required documentation the articles below and report the center budget and policy priorities highlight this very serious problem hospitals physicians and pharmacies may not willing treat these individuals until they have source payment but they cannot qualify for medicaid until they produce birth certificate and this new federal requirement was added medicaid the deficit reduction act dra enacted february the tax relief and health care act trhca signed into law december included some amendments the dra citizenship documentation requirement primarily exempt certain groups prior enactment the dra states were permitted use their discretion requiring such citizenship documentation under section the dra citizens applying for renewing their medicaid coverage must provide satisfactory documentary evidence citizenship nationality the dra specifies documents that are acceptable for this purpose and authorizes the secretary designate additional acceptable documents federal matching funds are available for services provided individuals who declare they are citizens nationals unless the state obtains satisfactory evidence their citizenship determines that they are subject statutory exemption according crs report for congress updated april based recent survey the government accountability office gao states report declines enrollment due the new citizenship documentation requirement based another survey the kaiser commission medicaid and the uninsured states report significant negative impact enrollment and anoter stal teport modest impact among seven states detailed earlier report from the center budget and policy priorities only wisconsin has data system that can identify denials and terminations due lack citizenship documentation and reports that about people had their medicaid eligibility denied termifiated for this reason between july and march second wave study conducted from september march the department health policy the george washington university school public health published october another distressing finding the impact the citizenship documentation requirements appear having schip many states for important reasons use joint applications for both medicaid and separate schip programs the effect however apply the citizenship documentation requirements both programs thereby delaying coverage for both groups children even most all the reported medicaid enrollment declines are due the citizenship documentation requirement key question whether the people who are being denied terminated deterred from applying are citizens rather than unauthorized aliens other ineligible noncitizens the states reporting enrollment declines gao majority states attribute them medicaid coverage delays losses for people who appear citizens important note that citizenship documentation requirements not affect medicaid rules relating immigrants they apply individuals claiming citizens most new legal immigrants are excluded from medicaid during their first five years the and undocumented immigrants remain eligible for medicaid emergency services only the legislation introducing would make several very important changes current law ensure that citizens receive the medicaid which they are entitled first the legislation would restore citizenship verification state option specifically states would permitted determine when and what extent citizenship verification required citizens states would also permitted utilize the standards most appropriate the their population long such standards were more stringent than those currently used the social security administration and includes native american tribal documents when appropriate second the legislation would ensure that individuals are afforded reasonable time period provide citizenship documentation utilizing the same reasonable time period standard that available legal immigrants provide satisfactory evidence their immigration status third the legislation protects children who are citizens virtue being born the united states from being denied coverage after birth because citizenship verification requirements fourth the legislation also clarifies ambiguities federal law ensure that these citizen children regardless the immigration status their parents are treated like all other lowincome children born the united states and are deemed eligible receive medicaid services for one year finally the legislation also ensures that the thousands citizen children and adults who were erroneously denied medicaid coverage may receive retroactive medicaid eligibility for coverage they were inappropriately denied because citizenship verification requirements urge colleagues the senate support this critical legislation which protects lowincome citizens from being inappropriately denied medicaid coverage because lack documentation president ask unanimous consent that the text the bill and letters support printed the record

all heard the opinion around the world about how awful the situation the middle east awful terrible when see children hurt when see them killed when see families distressed their economy worsens terrible sight was the gaza strip some years ago bringing good news and financial assistance the people the gaza they opened new airport was during the time that arafat was president there was hope springing all around that maybe they could get out the misery that existed the gaza strip and develop orderly society israel democracy area many nations that are less than democratic when these economies flourish the wealth falls into few hands who build their buildings take their resources and buy bigger yachts and bigger airplanes for themselves and not for their countries but there was hope that maybe the gaza strip would become place opportunity for its people that why was pleased there and bring the promise aid upon which had agreed there was hamas there that time now hamas there making determinations about its future and the future the people the gaza apparently the choice hamas continue the assault israel and not let discussions takeplace one those people who support twostate commitment there knowing full well that israel place that could share its knowledge and experience with the people gaza but hamas refuses that terrorist organization remember trip took with several colleagues when went iraq and the way stopped jordan and syria and spoke the president syria and asked him try curb the activities hamas securing the borders said why are you encouraging hamas find refuge here have their headquarters here along with hezbollah president asad said they are social service organization social servicemr president that more social service organization than the people who attacked than the people who attacked the british train system than those who attack innocent people various countries and cities terrorism our throat have wary has changed the way our society functions look all the inspections you through you want catch airplane into public buildingsalways with card know the results terrorism destroy democratic society take away the choices people have their lives says women have conduct themselves certain way satisfactory and not have rights participate financial opportunities for themselves and their families and look hamas and have ask does really care about the people gaza simply dedicated its terrorist ways for the answer can review how hamas conducts itself once again human being person who cares about life and family distressed see the loss life that taking place gaza and israel people are injured and frightened out their homesand yet even their home can place where misery prevails but hamas has attacked israel firing rockets and even now when perhaps possible get ceasefire they insist continuing rocket firing have seen the opinions countries around the world they look this situation instead just criticizing israel why isnt said that hamas terrorist organization that wants take away peoples rights that wants permit their innocent citizens used decoysin schools and mosques and other placesto try hide the militants who are firing rockets into israel hamas starts saying they dont recognize the right the state israel exist but israel has that right and shall defend that right she has built society from the sands society that flourishes not just the economic side but the scientific and research side they have figured out how grow crops areas that were arid and how develop the technology that israel knowp for the practice medicifie another thing that israel known for there facility israel that helped fund memory father who died very young man years oldfrom cancer there scientist who lived new jersey and was professor our principal institution rutgers university and asked would help fund laboratory and facility there that did cancer research said yes that was some time ago know they have arab students there and they have arab professors there and they all cooperate helping people maintain good health have all seen stories the paper about the young arab child who came israel brought her father have heart transplant this way israeli science reaches out people all nations and all religions israel has right exist and right exist peace and would more than willing bring the countries surrounding israel participate programs for peace has with medicine but there caniot real peace without security israel taking appropriate action ensure the security its people and ask them less unfair impossible say them that had rockets falling boston would not respond had rockets falling newark would not respond can tell you resident new jersey where have mile strip that said the fbi the most dangerous mile strip the country for terrorist attack are constantly the alert have boats there have guards all over the place and make sure are ready defend ourselves not only israel defending itself would against deadly aggression also putting stop the psychological warfare that has become daily part life for the people southern israel innocent civilians live with constant fear that rocket might kill them their children destroy their home israel like the united states determined protect and safeguard its people after america sought eliminate threats our country from osama bin laden and alqaida now israel seeking eliminate threats from ongoing terrorist attacks cannot kid ourselves about the strategy that hamas used gain power gaza hamas built its image among the palestinian people painting itself social service provider but they really cared about the palestinian people they would not use them human shields and they would not use the rooftops homes launch rocket attacks the events the past few weeks illustrate the world that terrorist groups cannot permitted menacing the free world with terror attacks and there are countries that are safe from this kind assault hamas has shown that cares more about destruction than about improving the lives the people gaza hamas leaders have chosen ignore the fact that their people are suffering poverty and instead have focused exclusively hurting israel ask hamas stand show that you care about your people and stop attacking israels citizens there will tense days ahead israel and gaza and deeply concerned about the loss innocent life the pain losing family member and injuries that may last for lifetime put stop the loss innocent life hamas must come its senses and pursue ceasefire that sustainable and durable israel should joined nations around the worldin pursuing ceasefire because terror ultimately possible their own states and their own communities whether india whether france whether spain whether the whether america saw there only one way bring real peace and real security the middle east stop the rockets and get the people the bargaining table negotiations are being attempted with egypts active participation have
